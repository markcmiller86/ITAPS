<h1>Use of CCA Technologies in the ITAPS Interface Definition Efforts</h1>

<p><i><a href="http://www.cca-forum.org/ccttss">
Center for Technology for Advanced Scientific Component Software</a><br />
PI: David Bernholdt (ORNL), ITAPS Point of Contact: L. Diachin (LLNL)</i></p>

<p>We have close collaborations with various members of the TASCS SciDAC
center and have worked with them in a number of different ways to
ensure that ITAPS and CCA technologies will be compatible.  In particular,
a pervading theme in the ITAPS center work is the creation of
interoperable technologies for meshing and discretization tools.
Critical to this effort is the development of common interfaces that
support mesh and data field access at many different levels of
sophistication, and we are collaborating with the Center for Component
Technology and the CCA Forum to define these interfaces. 
For SC01, we worked with several members of TASCS to demonstrate the
use of ITAPS mesh components in the CCAFFIENE CCA-compliant framework
to solve a time-dependent PDE.  As mentioned in the meshing
interoperability section, we are also working closely with SIDL and
Babel to investigate the creation of language independent mesh
components.  Our basic interfaces are defined using SIDL, and
additional work is now underway to determine the best way to provide
high performance interfaces for entity-by-entity interactions.</p>


<p>Throughout SciDAC-1, the interface definition group has
worked in conjunction with the Common Component Architecture (CCA)
Forum in a number of ways to ensure that the ITAPS interfaces are
compatible with CCA specifications.  Our efforts fall into two major
categories.</p>

<p>First, we have done a significant amount of work to understand and use
the <a href="http://www.llnl.gov/CASC/components">Scientific Interface Definition Language (SIDL)</a> and associated
Babel compiler developed as part of the CCA effort.  This work is
motivated by the fact that many of the ITAPS tools are written in C++
and most of our targeted applications are written in Fortran.  We did
not wish to settle for the least common denominator solution of
using arrays for all of our data transfer.  Thus we are using the SIDL
tool to define our interfaces in a language independent manner and to
facilitate the consistent and efficient implementation of language
bindings to these interfaces.  In particular, we have generated and
used the C, C++ and Fortran bindings for various ITAPS mesh
implementations.  In addition, LLNL has created a prototype interface
for fields and operators using SIDL. Ongoing work is being performed to
clearly understand the performance ramifications of using SIDL/Babel,
particularly on fine-grained operations such as entity-by-entity
access to mesh geometry and topology.  In particular, we are
investigating the possibility of providing language- or tool-specific
access to the underlying meshes for the cases where high performance
is critical for this type of access.  Early efforts include a
development of a C++ version of the ITAPS interface that bypasses the
SIDL intermediate object representation (written in C).  However this
work is very preliminary; much more needs to be done to evaluate the
performance ramifications of SIDL on our interface and to develop
solutions that are compatible with the SIDL specification.
</p>

<p>Second we are developing ITAPS and CCA-compliant mesh components and
using them with other numerical components to demonstrate their
ability to solve application problems.  The first application involves
a two-dimensional ITAPS mesh that was used in conjunction with time
integrator, linear solver, MxN redistribution, and visualization
components (all developed at different labs as part of the CCA Forum
efforts) to solve a time dependent PDE in the CCAFFIENE framework
developed at SNL.  This work was demonstrated at SC01 and continues to
be used to illustrate complex application scenarios in the quarterly
CCA tutorials.  The second application was developed using the NWGrid
meshing software from PNNL.  In this case, a SIDL version of the TSTT
interface was used to generate a Fortran binding for NWGrid so that it
could be used with a mesh quality improvement component (based on
Opt-MS algorithms from ANL) that was written in C.  These components
were successfully deployed and used in the DeCaf framework developed
by LLNL.</p>
