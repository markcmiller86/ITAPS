<h2>Pellet ablation for tokamak fueling</h2>

In a recent collaboration with fusion scientists at General Atomics,
we used the FronTier-Lite front tracking library to study the physics
of pellet ablation for tokamak fueling. Obtaining a deep understanding
of this phenomenon is necessary for the successful operation of ITER,
an international research collaboration that aims to
demonstrate the scientific and technical feasibility of fusion
power. Plans call for fueling ITER by injection of frozen deuterium
pellets which ablate when interacting with the hot fusion plasmas; the
lower the quasi-steady state ablation rate, the higher the fueling
efficiency. However the physical processes associated with this
ablation are not clearly understood and advanced modeling and
simulation tools are being used to shed light on these processes. </p>

Figure: A schematic of ITER and of the physical processes associated with
crygenic deuterium pellet ablation in a tokamak magnetic field.  Hot
electrons traveling along the magnetic field lines hit the pellet
surface causing a rapid ablation.  A cold, dense cloud forms around
the pellet and shields it from incoming hot electrons.  The most
important processes determining pellet ablation from that point
forward occur in the cloud.

Using the front tracking technology developed by the ITAPS Center, we
have developed novel mathematical models and computational software
for the numerical simulation of the pellet ablation for tokamak
fueling. Using this software, the pellet ablation rate and lifetime in
magnetic fields were systematically studied for the first time and
compared with theory and experimental databases. 
Simulations revealed several new features of the pellet ablation such
as, contrary to expectations, the ablation rate depends strongly on
the magnetic field strength. This new feature implies that pellets
traversing strong plasma gradients, as in the edge pedestal region of
the ITER plasma, could have significantly lower ablation rates (higher
fueling efficiency) if injected at higher velocity.</p>

<h2>Adaptive Loops for Extended Magnetohydrodynamics Modeling</h2>

The
SciDAC-funded ``Center for Extended MHD modeling (CEMM)'' has
extensively used a 3D MHD code to simulate global instabilities in
magnetic fusion devices.  The ITAPS team is working with CEMM fusion
scientists to extend the MHD high-order finite element software
(M3D-C1) to interface with unstructured mesh adaptation
technologies. This enables them to gain the efficiencies of using
adaptive meshes (see the figure below for isotropic and
anisotropic adapted meshes) and allows them to
model general curved reactor domains (see the rightmost image in the
Figure). In a related effort, we are working to
apply new interface smoothing capabilities in Mesquite to tokamak
meshes from the Princeton Plasma Physics Lab (PPPL) with the goal of
improving quality while preserving grid alignment with magnetic field
lines.

In a collaborative effort, ITAPS, CEMM, and TOPS researchers have also
developed flexible data structures and interfaces to enable M3D-C1 to
use advanced linear algebraic solvers. In the new extended software,
SuperLU_dist is used to factor the large sparse matrix associated
with the M3D-C1 implicit formulation for the 2F MHD equations every
5-20 time-steps instead of every time-step as in the original
software. In the intervening time steps, the last factored matrix is
used as a very effective preconditioner for a GMRES-based iterative
solve in PETSc, which then requires only a few iterations to
converge. In the initial application, this resulted in a net speed
increase of about 70% for a 2D "approach to 2F equilibrium with flow
in NSTX" application. This accomplishment is regarded as a major
milestone in transitioning M3D-C1 into an efficient and scalable 3D
nonlinear 2F MHD code.

simulation of a reconnection problem.  Major work includes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Proper definition of periodic boundary conditions such that they are consistently
handled in iMesh, iGeom, and iMeshP.</li>
<li>Transfer of field information to the adapted mesh such that conservation of energy
and magnetic flux is satisfied</li>
<li>Higher quality error indication routines.</li>
<li>Spatial stabilization and variational multiscale models for Extended MHD simulations.</li>

<h2> First wall shield design for ITER.</h2>

<p>The success of ITER depends on the ability of components to withstand
high fluences of 14MeV neutrons and the heat loads and other effects
of this radiation exposure.  This is of particular importance in the
diagnostic ports and plasma-facing components; the US is responsible
for providing 20% of these components as part of its ITER commitment.
Fast ray-tracing on facet-based models derived from CAD geometry
enables 3D analysis of radiation transport in these components.  The
ITAPS solution transfer service is used to provide radiation heating
as a source term for fluid flow and heat transfer calculations.  These
analyses are an integral part of the design process for these
components, ensuring they can withstand radiation-induced heating
and damage while maintaining structural integrity.  This work is
funded by the US ITER project. </p>
