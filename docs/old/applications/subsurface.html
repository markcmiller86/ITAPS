Subsurface transport codes, such as the STOMP code
developed at PNNL, are used for simulating the flow and transport of
multi-scale, multi-phase components (fluids, gases, and reactive
species) through complex underground structures.  DOE applications of
these codes include modeling remediation strategies for the cleanup of
heavy metal radioactive waste and the design and study of carbon
sequestration strategies in subsurface repositories.  In collaboration
with the ``Hybrid Numerical Methods for Multiscale Simulations of
Subsurface Biogeochemical Processes'' SciDAC project, the ITAPS team
is developing new techniques for the next generation of subsurface
transport codes in two ways.  First, we are developing a new code that
combines the STOMP subsurface transport code formulations with ITAPS
unstructured mesh capabilities to capture complex subsurface topology
such as intersecting layers and faulted structures.  We have been
working closely with the STOMP team to define the best way to map a
library of unstructured STOMP mesh primitives onto the ITAPS mesh
interface which has been implemented in NWGrid/NWPhys.  In our second
activity with PNNL scientists, we are using the the FronTier
front-tracking library to simulate reactive transport and mineral
precipitation in fractured and porous media. Our
research suggests that these techniques will be more cost effective
than the standard Smooth Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH) approach, and we
will compare the two methods for accuracy and computational cost.  We
have made good progress on modeling the reactive deposition of
minerals on the rock surface using FronTier. The Figure below
shows the solute concentration in a 2D
simulation of crystal growth.  The comparison has shown that the front
tracking method gives good agreement with the SPH method in 2D when
the effect of curvature is considered. Currently, we are carrying
out 3D validations.
