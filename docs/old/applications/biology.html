<p>An emerging DOE application area for mesh-based modeling is in the
area of computational biology.  The face of biology is changing as new
methods are brought to bear on the study of living systems.  In fact,
it is the transition from viewing biology as a set of components to
treating it by a systems approach that will truly revolutionize the
field.  Biology does not occur at any one scale, rather it occurs from
scales as small as an atomic ion, e.g., Ca2+ to scales as large as
complex human populations and their interactions with the environment.
A key element in any study of modern biology and the impact of
understanding it in terms of human health or in terms of the impact of
microbial systems on the environment is the ability to cross many
temporal and spatial scales in order to connect diverse data and
predict biological behavior at the systems level.</p>


<p>In addition to the five primary SciDAC application areas that the ITAPS
Center supports, we are also incorporating ITAPS meshing and
discretization capabilities into DOE-funded computational biology
applications. This activity is designed to coordinate and cultivate a
relationship between ITAPS capabilities and DOE's biology
areas. Specifically, this was done by incorporating ITAPS
(NWGrid/NWPhys) mesh technology and CCA-compliant component technology
into two ongoing DOE programmatic areas in Microbial Cell Biology (DOE
LAB 01-20) and Computational Biology (DOE LAB 01-21). In addition,
application support was provided to several internal PNNL LDRD
projects that are directed toward multi-scale computational biology,
like the Virtual Lung Project and Nano-biology projects. The main
focus of these efforts is in image reconstruction and feature
extraction of computational geometry and meshes representing complex
biological systems that include everything from individual cells
(procaryotic and eucaryotic) to organs (like lungs, upper respiratory
systems, whole organisms). The figure on the left represents the
process of extracting the meshed geometry of a lung and arterial
branching tree from the volume image data for a CT scan of a human
chest. The figure on the right represents the process of extracting
the computational geometry and mesh for the upper respiratory tract of
a rat based on volume NMR images. The following two figures are
simulations of microbial cell communities (left) and microbial cell
biofilms (right) using the ITAPS NWGrid/NWPhys mesh generation and
discretization codes. The figure on the left is of the diffusion of
oxygen into a community of Shewanella bacteria (images are from
confocal microscopy where the microbes have been stained using
GFP. The figure on the right is the growth of a biofilm within a
bioreactor (imaged using NMR).</p>
