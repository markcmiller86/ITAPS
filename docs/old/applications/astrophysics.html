<p>During SciDAC-1, ITAPS researchers at ORNL had collaborations with the
astrophysics SciDAC-1 center: the Terascale Supernova Initiative (TSI)
led by Mezzacappa.  The primary focus was the exploration of
alternative discretization strategies for various aspects of the
solution process.  In addition, they explored a 3D
spatial caching strategy to reduce costly evaluations of the
scattering kernels for Boltzman transport.</p>

<p>With the TSI team, ITAPS researchers at ORNL explored new schemes
for solving models of radiative transfer in stellar atmospheres
representative of supernova type 2 core collapse/explosions. The
current solution method, namely, discrete ordinates, in conjunction
with finite differences, may require petascale computing power when
extended to three dimensions. The ITAPS/TSI interaction was aimed at
exploring novel schemes that are able to keep computational
requirements at the terascale level.</p>

<p>A series of radiative transfer prototype problems have been chosen by
the TSI group. These problems are simplified forms of Boltzmann's
integro-differential equation for radiative transfer and thus have
features significant to supernova collapse/explosion modeling.</p>

<p>The first problem, Milne's axis-symmetric pure scattering of photons
in extended stellar atmospheres, has been studied successfully. In
this problem the dependent variable is the radiative intensity field
(photon distribution function), and the independent variables are the
radius of the spherical stellar atmosphere and the polar angle made by
the radius and the photon velocity vector. The new method of analysis
consists of a discontinuous Galerkin (DG) approach for the
approximation of the radiative intensity field in phase space (the
Cartesian product of the one-dimensional radius domain and the polar
angle domain). The integro-differential equation is treated as a
linear hyperbolic PDE at each step of an iterative scheme that
corrects the value of the integral scattering kernel. Each iteration
is accelerated by evaluating the kernel from the first and zeroth
moments of the original problem. The DG method applied to the linear
hyperbolic problem at each iteration was implemented explicitly in
phase space since the characteristic curves are known a priori. This
allows the resulting linear algebraic set of equations to be solved
locally and progressively along wave fronts normal to the
characteristics. The DG method developed for the Milne's problem was
found to be memory efficient (requiring one order of magnitude less
storage than the discrete ordinate method) and fast (one order of
magnitude faster than DOM). In addition, in view of the adaptive mesh
used, the results were significantly more accurate when capturing
important features of the solution. For instance, the region of
transition from diffusive radiation to streaming was correctly
captured, and the outward peaking (a delta function like sharp
increase) of the radiation field at the outer boundary of the extended
atmosphere was correctly reproduced. The results were obtained for a
range of atmosphere sizes including the range of interest to supernova
applications.  Although the results are exciting, supernova models are
significantly more complex, involving the extended set of equations
that couple neutrino radiation transfer to relativistic flow, that is
radiative hydrodynamics.</p>

<p>Another interaction between ITAPS and TSI is the use of a 3D spatial
cache for avoiding redundant and costly evaluations of scattering
kernels for Boltzmann transport. The scattering kernel is a function
of density, temperature and species fraction. We have generated trace
data over a realistic TSI computation and visualized the trajectories
of evaluation in 3D phase space (density, temperature, species
fraction). Initial analysis shows 3D interpolation with a small global
cache has good hit ratio of over 90%, or about 9 of 10 evaluations of
scattering kernels can be computed by 3D interpolation instead of the
actual costly computations.</p>
