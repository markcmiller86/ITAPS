<h1>Getting Started with ITAPS Software</h1>

ITAPS software is a continually growing suite of interoperable
software products divided, conceptually, into three distinct
categories; <it> integrated-Services, component-Services </it> and
<it> interfaces</it>.  <it>Interfaces</it> for mesh, geometry, fields
and the relationships among them are the fundamental infrastructure
necessary to create interoperable scientific computing software
products. These <it>interfaces</it> are one of the key enabling
technologies the ITAPS Center is responsible for developing and
maintaining.<br>

<br>
In addition, the ITAPS Center is using the <it>interfaces</it> to
componentize existing and new mesh and geometry tools to create
<it>component-services</it> as well as integrating these products to
create high-level <it> integrated-services</it>.  We note that many of
the tools in the ITAPS software suite exist in two forms; an
<it>ITAPS-compliant</it> version and its <it>Conventional</it>
counterpart which may or may not include the necessary wrappers to
work with ITAPS interfaces.  We provide links only to the
ITAPS-compliant versions of the software on these web pages; in most
cases, the conventional versions are available for download from their
home institutions or you may contact the ITAPS POC for more
information.<br>

<br>
Lastly, and most importantly, for a targeted set of applications, the
ITAPS Center provides direct, hands-on, customer support to end-user
application developers who want to integrate ITAPS software products
with their applications [contact <a
href="mailto:diachin2@llnl.gov">Lori Diachin</a> about this
support]. The ITAPS software suite is the result of a collaboration of
the interface design and integration expertise of the ITAPS Center
with component developers in the broader scientific computing
community.<br>

<br>
When getting ready to use ITAPS software for the first time, the first
thing to consider what tools you are interested in using and how you
are hoping to work with them. Typically, application software
developers are interested in ITAPS software because they would like to
incorporate functionality provided by integrated or component level
services into their own application codes.  More information on usage
strategies for application scientists can be found <a
href="./usage_strategies.html">here</a>.  In contrast, developers of pre-
or post-processing tools who want to make their tools available to a
wide community of users are interested in ITAPS <it> Interfaces.</it>
The list below briefly describes each of the three categories of ITAPS
software and provides links to pages that describe software in that
category in more detail as well as where current releases may be
obtained.<br> <br>
