<h1>ITAPS Software</h1>

<p>Information related to accessing, downloading and using the ITAPS
center software is available on these pages.
The interfaces developed by the ITAPS team are separated into the base (iBase), geometry
(iGeom), mesh (iMesh) , field (iField), and relation (iRel)
specifications. Each specification is defined using both a C-specific interface
as well as using the Scientific Inteface Definition Language and Babel compiler.
In addition, a number of services that are directly useful to applications programmers
are available for download. In all cases we provide pointers to obtain more information,
documentation, software downloads and the appropriate point of contact.
