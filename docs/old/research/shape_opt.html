<h1>Geometry and Meshing Support for Shape Optimization</h1>Geometric
shape optimization is a powerful capability with applications in
accelerator cavity design and other areas.&nbsp; Shape optimization
requires a diverse set of supporting services involving both geometric
(CAD) models and mesh handling.&nbsp; These services must be automated,
to enable the optimization process to iterate without human
intervention.<br />
<br />
A service supporting CAD-based shape optimization has been developed
under ITAPS.&nbsp; The approach taken is shown below.&nbsp; In
iteration 0, the tool starts with a parameter vector p0, and generates
a geometric model G(p0); generates a mesh m(p0) using the CUBIT mesh
generation tool based on that geometric model; and generates a
sensitivity or derivative vector d(x)/dp. The resulting mesh and
sensitivities are input to the physics and optimization procedure,
which generate a new parameter vector vk.&nbsp; In subsequent
iterations, the new parameter vector is used to generate a new
geometric model G(pk), and a mesh for that model is derived from the
original mesh, m(p0), by projecting boundary vertices to the new
geometry and smoothing.&nbsp; Geometry and mesh models are represented
using the CGM and MOAB libraries, respectively.&nbsp; Mesh generation
is performed using the mesh generation toolkit, and mesh smoothing
using the Mesquite mesh improvement library.&nbsp; Generation of a
geometric model given a parameter vector, computing the sensitivities
with respect to parameters, and coordination of the mesh projection
process is performed by the DDRIV
code library and executable driver.&nbsp; DDRIV is available as open
source software from Argonne National Laboratory.<br />

Steps in this process are shown with an actual model below. <br />

<p>In the approach above, a finite difference method is used to compute
the change in vertex positions with respect to parameters.&nbsp; The
convergence of this method has been tested by varying both the number
of mesh elements and the size of parameter variations.&nbsp; The
derivative converged quickly in both cases, verifying that a finite
difference-based method is appropriate.</p>
<p>In the
longer term, methods for treating larger parameter variations, leading
to topological changes to the underlying geometric model, should be
investigated. This may require the introduction of re-meshing and/or
local mesh topological changes to the process to improve mesh quality.
This research could use the dynamic mesh services,
parallel mesh generation,
and parallel deforming mesh
capabilities developed under ITAPS. DDRIV is available as open source
software; contact Tim Tautges (tautges at mcs.anl.gov) for details. </p>
