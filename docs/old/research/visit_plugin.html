<h1>VisIt Plugins</h1>

<p>A key service required by ITAPS users is the ability to visualize
data from iMesh implementations.  To provide this functionality, we
are collaborating with the VACET SciDAC center to create an ITAPS
database plugin for VisIt; their primary delivery vehicle.  The plugin
currently provides access to basic iMesh data (vertices, regions,
etc), the ability to write data to an iMesh implementation, some
support for iMesh sets and tags, and support for zone- and
node-centered fields as dense tags.  In the initial implementation of
the iMesh plugin and the integration of iMesh with VisIt, a user was
required to select a particular implementation of the iMesh interface
at the time VisIt was configured. That implementation and only that
implementation would then be supported by the resulting installation
of VisIt. We added logic to VisIt's configuration tools to allow this
constraint was relaxed and a single installation of VisIt can support
multiple implementations of iMesh. 

<p>We have demonstrated that a single
VisIt executable can display data from the MOAB, FMDB, and GRUMMP
implementations of iMesh simultaneously. This demonstration also
served as an important ITAPS milestone in that it was the first time
multiple implementations of iMesh were linked together into a common
executable further proving the interoperability of the iMesh
interface.  Finally, to support parallel visualization for ITAPS,
VisIt's iMesh plugin was used as a starting point to develop one based
on iMeshP.  A prototype iMeshP-based plugin was demonstrated on a 4
processor parallel run with FMDB.
