<h1>AMR Front Tracking</h1>

<p>
FronTier (SUNY SB and BNL) has been used to
apply the front-tracking method to different scientific problems such
as gas dynamics, petroleum reservoir study, MHD and solid interface
problems.
Our goal within the context of the
ITAPS center is to combine the strengths of the FronTier and various
block-structured adaptive mesh refinement codes
to develop a new, efficient front-tracking algorithm combined
with the AMR technique, the so-called AMR Front Tracking Method.

<p>Our focus is on the three-dimensional coupling and the design of a
code interface with different AMR libraries including Overture,
SAMRAI, and Chombo, the last of which is developed by the APDEC SciDAC
Center. To achieve interoperability with all three AMR packages, we
have designed a common interface for block-structured AMR codes and
redesigned the FronTier-AMR module to use these interfaces.  The
corresponding wrappers for the Overture package are functional and in
use; wrappers for the SAMRAI and Chombo codes are being written and
tested.

<p> The most difficult part of the work has been in the generalization
of patch and subdomain communications. Although FronTier is
parallelized, the data communication between patches inside the same
parallel processor is outside of the development framework. As a
result, we needed to find a practical method to synchronize the
computation of different patches inside the same parallel
processor. We finally decided to modify the entire functional
structure of the interface propagation in the FronTier code to have it
fully modularized at the synchronization points inside a single driver
function. Figure 8 shows the adaptive patches with the tracked front.
