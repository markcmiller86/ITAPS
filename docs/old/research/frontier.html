<h1>Front Tracking</h1>

<p>
Front tracking method is a Lagrangian method for the propagation
of a moving manifold. Front tracking works by moving marker particles which
represent the interface. It is distinguished from the marker particle method 
in that the particles are located only on the interface, rather than 
in a volume region near the interface, and in that the particles are 
connected to each other, to form a triangulated mesh (3D) or piecewise 
linear segments (2D) of the interface. It is significantly faster than other
particle methods, since fewer particles (one or two in 2D) are used 
per cell in front tracking than the number used in typical particle method 
simulations. 2D bifurcations of interface topology in front tracking are 
resolved accurately through detection of interface intersections.
In three dimensions, we use a local Eulerian reconstruction method.
This method has the robustness of the Eulerian method while it
maintains the high resolution and accuracy of the Lagrangian method.</p>

<p>The front tracking method has showed its advantage in the computation of
several important physical problems such as the study of
fluid interface instabilities, providing the first or the only physically
validated simulation for the solution of turbulent mixing. Figure 1
shows the dynamic motion of the two fluid interface in the simulation of
three dimensional Rayleigh-Taylor instability.</p>

<p>Supported by the ITAPS grant of DOE, we have extracted the geometrical
component of the front tracking code as a stand-alone software library
named FronTier-Lite.
We have also built a user interface to allow easy loading of the library
to any application program which requires the tracking of a moving front.
This library provides a toolkit to make, copy and manipulate the data structures
of the meshed interface. It contains functionality for mathematical
calculations with respect to the moving interface and tools to couple
the moving interface with computational domains bounded by the
moving interface. The library hides the most complicated operations of
mesh redistribution and topological bifurcation from the eyes of the 
user and provides a pleasant, smooth and accurate computation of the 
moving front. All the users need to do is to provide the initialization 
of the manifold and the velocity field for the propagation of the front. 
Figure 2 shows the three dimensional surface evolution of a sphere under
a prescribed shear velocity field. The FronTier library also furnishes
the calculation of such geometry-dependent variables as normal and curvature
at the interface, thus enabling users to perform computation of
interface propagation in the direction of the surface normal,
when the speed that is a function of curvature.</p>

<p>Besides the study of the Rayleigh-Taylor instability, the FronTier library
has also been applied to the simulation of diesel fuel-injection,
a part of SciDAC combustion study and many other problems. For example,
Figure 3 shows the application of the FronTier-Lite code in the simulation
of the forest fire front with two initial fire fronts.</p>
