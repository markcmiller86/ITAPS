<h1>Interpolation Kernels</h1>
<p>
The fields defined over meshes will often be manipulated and modified
to meet specific needs during operations such as transferring fields
between meshes, extracting derived quantities, etc.  The interpolation
kernels service will support these needs and will include
functionality to construct new field distributions including (i) using
higher order interpolants, (ii) providing higher order continuity over
the mesh, or (iii) satisfying specific conservation
requirements. Functions will also be developed to support efficient
field transfer operations that account for interacting grids that are
structured, unstructured, interfaced or overlapped and build upon
existing capabilities such as those available in Overture for
overlapping and hybrid grids.  Efforts on these procedures will be
coordinated with the proposed discretization centers to avoid
duplication and ensure compatibility with those efforts.
