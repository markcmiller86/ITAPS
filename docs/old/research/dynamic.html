<h1>Dynamic Parallel Data Services</h1>
<p>
Dynamic parallel data services, such as parallel partitioning, dynamic
load balancing, data migration, unstructured communication maps, and
geometrically-based processor searches, are crucial to petascale performance of
mesh-based simulations.
For example, with adaptive mesh refinement, processor
workloads change as elements are added and deleted;
dynamic load balancing and data migration are needed to redistribute
work after 
adaptation. 
Our experiments on the IBM BG/L have shown that even
differences of 5-10% between the maximum and average processor
workloads can lead to dramatic losses of scalability in applications.
Similarly, unstructured communication maps and
geometrically-based processor searches are key components of solution
transfer schemes.  Although many frameworks implement 
these services internally, their implementations are data-structure 
specific, preventing interoperability with components not in the frameworks. 
We are developing
dynamic services that work through the ITAPS interfaces, allowing them
to be used easily by SciDAC applications.

<p>
In particular, we have adopted the Zoltan Dynamic Load-Balancing
toolkit to provide load balancing services to ITAPS applications such
as accelerator design, subsurface transport, and climate modeling.
Zoltan contains a suite of parallel dynamic
load-balancing methods, including geometric, graph-based, and
hypergraph-based algorithms as well as interfaces to the popular
graph-partitioning packages PT-Scotch and
ParMETIS.  In SciDAC-2, we have extended Zoltan's
capabilities by developing a mesh-based service using the ITAPS iMesh
and iMeshP interfaces.  Our new dynamic service, iZoltan, allows iMesh
and iMeshP implementations to easily compute new mesh distributions,
migrate entities to new parts, and update iMeshP part and partition
information.  We have demonstrated the effectiveness and
interoperability of our serial partitioning capability using the iMesh
interfaces to FMDB, MOAB, and GRUMMP; our parallel capabilities have
been tested and adopted in FMDB. Zoltan is open-source and is widely
used in the national laboratories, academia, and industry, with over
1800 downloads since 2001.
<p>
Going forward, we will extend iZoltan's capabilities to handle
arbitrary partition objects (for specialized cases such as boundary
layers), user-specified partition entities and adjacencies, and
hierarchical partitioning for large number of parts and processors.
In collaboration with the CSCAPES Institute, we will also
incorporate and extend the petascale partitioning techniques developed
under ITAPS.
