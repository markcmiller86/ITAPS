<h1>Mesh Smoothing</h1>

<p>
It has long been known that achieving accurate and efficient numerical
solutions to PDE-based applications depends heavily on mesh
quality. To improve the meshes generated as part of the ITAPS project,
we are developing a mesh quality improvement toolkit called
Mesquite. The primary aim of this project is to provide a freely
available, comprehensive software package that would accommodate a
number of different mesh element types, quality metrics, high-level
solution strategies, and mesh optimization algorithms. We designed
Mesquite from the ground up in SciDAC-1, based on mesh quality
improvement algorithms and software developed previously at SNL and
ANL.  

<p>Mesquite Version 1.0 was released in mid-2005. We have assembled
a team of ITAPS/Mesquite researchers & developers including 
Lori Diachin (LLNL), Martin Isenburg (LLNL), Patrick Knupp (SNL), and Jason
Kraftcheck (UW). Mesquite was designed to be easily extensible in
order to support new research in mesh quality improvement and to allow
rapid delivery of prototype mesh optimization algorithms to
applications. The use of classes such as MeshQualityMetric,
ObjectiveFunction, QualityAssessor, TerminationCriterion, VertexMover,
and InstructionQueue help us achieve an object-oriented, flexible
design. Embedded within the various classes are member functions which
perform the computationally intensive numerical calculations. These
member functions avoid objects, use pointers, arrays, and other
low-level data structures to ensure that the computations are as
efficient as possible.</p>

<p>Mesquite Version 1.0 does mesh untangling, element shape improvement,
and deforming meshes on local mesh patches consisting of either
triangular, tetrahedral, quadrilateral, hexahedral, or hybrid
(including wedge and pyramid elements) unstructured meshes. The
prototype has a number of state-of-the-art algorithms for
optimization-based node point movement including steepest descent,
conjugate gradient, feasible Newton, and active set solvers. In
addition, considerable attention was given to the development of a
flat mesh data structure for the internal representation of
unstructured mesh data that is both highly efficient and
convenient. To obtain our mesh data from the application and to
provide interoperability, we use the iMesh common mesh interface
specification, upon which two important implementations, FMDB (RPI)
and MOAB (ANL), are based.</p>

<p>In SciDAC-1, Mesquite was (i) incorporated into the ITAPS Shape
Optimization service developed for the accelerator appplication, (ii)
used to generate different geodesic meshes used to test various
discretization methods for the CSU climate appliction, (iii) used in
ITAPS mesh generation programs in support of accelerators, biology,
and other applications. 

<p> During SciDAC-2, several significant new
capabilities have been added to Mesquite.  To improve the overall
speed, we have added new quasi-Newton and trust-region solvers in
collaboration with the TOPS SciDAC center. We have parallelized
Mesquite and implemented the distributed memory algorithm using the
iMesh and iMeshP interfaces.  Initial testing of the parallel
algorithm has demonstrated good scaling with 95% efficiency on up
to 256 processors; testing on larger numbers of processors is
underway.  New capabilities developed for SLAC include the
ability to smooth meshes containing high-order nodes. For fusion
applications, we have developed a ``mesh boundary smoothing''
capability to move nodes constrained to external boundaries and
internal interfaces such as magnetic field lines. Finally, we have
developed a prototype combined smoothing/swapping service using
Mesquite and the Swap service developed at UBC. Early results show
that cumulative benefits can be accrued from alternating use of
smoothing and swapping.  The Mesquite library has been downloaded over
660 times over the past four years and has been used in diverse
applications such as accelerator modeling, fusion, biology, climate,
rocket propellant burn, and ALE
