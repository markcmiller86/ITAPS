<center><h1>Strategies
for Integrating<br>
ITAPS Software with your Application</h1></center>

ITAPS software is a continually
growing suite of interoperable software products divided, conceptually,
into three distinct categories; <span style="font-style: italic;">Integrated-Services,
Component-Services </span>and<span style="font-style: italic;">
Interfaces</span>. The diagram below illustrates two
different methodologies for integration your application with software
in the ITAPS Software Suite. One method facilitates rapid prototyping
but, because it involves creating copies of the application's data
within an <span style="font-style: italic;">ITAPS-Interface
Implementation</span> is not the highest performance approach. The
other method essentially amounts to componentizing your application
with the ITAPS-Interface so that other Component Services within the
ITAPS Software Suite can interact with it.

This integration
effort is represented by the blue-green boxes (labeled ITAPS-Interface)
on the application. In addition, each Integrated- and Component-Service
with the ITAPS Software Suite may also require a handful of function
calls to be added to your application. This integration effort is
represented by the gray and/or magenta boxes (labeled ISx-Interface and
CS-Interface) on the application.

<br>
<br>
In integrating an
application with the ITAPS Interfaces, there are basically two
approaches. The first approach is suitable for rapid prototyping of
capability but not necessarily very high performance. It requires the
least amount of integration effort and utilizes a <span
 style="font-style: italic;">Storage-Proxy</span> to serve as the
intermediary for Components that need to interact with the
Application's data. This approach essentially involves "building up" a
copy of the application data inside an existing Implementation of the
ITAPS Interfaces by making appropriate calls to the handful of methods
in the ITAPS interfaces that enable an application to construct (as
opposed to query) a mesh. Once this handful of calls is made, a copy of
the Application's data is constructed inside the Storage Proxy from
which it can then be interacted with by all other ITAPS software
components.<br>
<br>
The higher performance approach essentially componentizes the
application by implementating the ITAPS interface to interact directly
with the Application's data. Depending on the Components the
Application wishes to use, a subset or a complete implementation of the
ITAPS interface(s) may be necessary. The specific portions of the ITAPS
Interfaces necessary to interact with different Component-Services are
defined for each Component-Service. In this way, the Application
becomse another component in the ITAPS Software Suite just like any
other component.
