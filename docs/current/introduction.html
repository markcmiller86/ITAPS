  <h1>Introduction</h1>


<p><strong><em>Our Vision. </em></strong> The advent of petascale computing will enable increasingly complex, realistic simulations of PDE-based applications.  Numerous software tools are available to help manage the complexity of these simulations, including computer-aided design systems used to represent the geometry of the computational domain, mesh generation tools to discretize those domains, solution adaptive methods (AMR) to improve the accuracy and efficiency of simulation techniques, and parallel tools such as dynamic partitioning to ease implementation on today's computer architectures. These tools would be particularly effective if they could be easily integrated and used in concert in existing simulations, or if they could enable integration of existing simulations into multi-physics, multi-scale codes.  At present, however, this type of integration is exceedingly difficult, largely due to software compatibility issues rather than underlying technical issues.  So that numerical simulations can be constructed more efficiently  using the latest technologies, the Center for Interoperable Technologies for  Advanced Petascale Simulations (ITAPS) will develop interoperable and interchangeable mesh, geometry, and field manipulation tools that are of direct use to SciDAC applications.  We are building on our  successes as the Terascale Simulations Tools and Technologies (TSTT) ISIC funded during SciDAC-1, and we will develop new tools in critical areas identified by SciDAC application teams. </p>
                    <p><strong><em>The Current State of Technology. </em></strong> In today's environment, there are many tools available that generate a variety of mesh types ranging from unstructured meshes of various types to overlapping structured meshes and hybrid meshes that include both structured and unstructured components (for an extensive list, see <a href="http://www-users.informatik.rwth-aachen.de/%7Eroberts/meshgeneration.html" target="_blank"> Robert Schneiders' web page</a>). Approximation techniques used on these meshes include finite difference (FD), finite volume (FV), finite element (FE), spectral element (SE), and discontinuous Galerkin (DG) methods. Any combination of these mesh and approximation types may be used to solve PDE-based problems. The fundamental concepts are the same for all approaches: some discrete representation of the geometry (the mesh) is used to approximate the physical domain, and some discretization procedure is used to represent approximate solutions and differential operators on the mesh. In addition, the concepts of adaptive mesh refinement for local resolution enhancement, time-varying meshes to represent moving geometry, data transfer between different meshes, and parallel decomposition of the mesh for computation on advanced computers are the same regardless of their implementation. In each case, the software tools providing these advanced capabilities are becoming increasingly accepted by the scientific community, but their application interfaces are not compatible. Thus interchanging technology is often a labor intensive and error prone code modification process that must be endured by the application scientist. This typically results in a lengthy diversion from the central scientific investigation and severely inhibits experimentation with improved mesh and discretization technologies.</p>
                    <p><strong><em>Research Goals.</em></strong> The premise of our technology development goal is that advanced mesh, geometry and field services can be provided as libraries that can be used with minimal intrusion into application codes.  During SciDAC-1, the ITAPS team developed and deployed a number of advanced technologies --- including the  Frontier-Lite front tracking  library, the  Mesquite mesh quality improvement toolkit, along with unstructured mesh refinement and swapping tools --- that provide ample evidence of the viability of this approach.  Moreover, we combined these  component services in an interoperable way to provide new  integrated services such as AMR-front tracking, parallel adaptive loop libraries, and combined geometry-mesh modification tools for use in shape optimization applications.  Critical to the ITAPS interoperability goal is the development of common interfaces that provide data-structure-neutral access to mesh, geometry, and field information.  These interfaces provide access to all ITAPS services in a uniform way and are fundamental to creating interoperability for the integrated services.  Moreover, a uniform interface allows easier experimentation with different, but functionally similar, technologies to determine which is best suited for a given application. The development of such interfaces requires creating consensus among a large group of mesh, geometry, and field experts; a difficult technical and sociological challenge that would have been impossible to achieve without the collaborative environment fostered by the SciDAC program. It is this bringing together of a wide range of DOE and university mesh-related technologies under a common interface that distinguishes ITAPS as a center. </p>
                    <p><strong><em>Application Use of ITAPS Technologies.</em></strong> Figure 1 shows the two ways that applications can use ITAPS services.  In the left figure (a), the application already has geometry, mesh, and/or field data and implements the ITAPS interfaces as wrapper functions around their own data structures.  Once the necessary interface functions are implemented and tested, the ITAPS services can easily access the application data they need through the ITAPS interface.  In the right figure (b), the application scientist can take advantage of data implementations already available from ITAPS for rapid prototyping of new applications.  This mode of access also allows easy access to ITAPS services using a very small number of function calls to copy the necessary data to a fully compliant implementation of the interface. In some cases the memory overhead associated with the data copy is relatively small and this access mode is sufficient for long term use. In other cases, it provides the mechanism for easy access to and experimentation with ITAPS services; as the benefits of the services become clear, application scientists can implement the interfaces more efficiently based on their own data structures. </p>

<p class="figCaption">Figure 1: A schematic showing the use of ITAPS interfaces and services in application codes.  The figure on the left (a) shows the use  of the interfaces implemented directly on the application data structures.  The  figure on the right (b) shows the use of a reference implementation of the  interfaces to provide immediate access to ITAPS services at the cost of a data copy.</p>

<p><strong><em>Related Efforts.</em></strong> The time is ripe for such an effort in the area of meshing and discretization technology. The existence of mature software tools in these fields allows us to examine them, and their use in applications, to extract the appropriate abstractions for developing common interfaces at both high and low levels. We note that such multi-institutional activities are underway in other scientific domains. For example, the <a href="http://www.sandia.gov/z-machine/" target="_blank">Equation Solver Interface (ESI) group [ESI]</a> is defining a set of common interfaces for linear solvers and preconditioners and is implementing them in a number of independently developed tools including, e.g., PETSc, ISIS++, and Aztec. In a related effort, the <a href="http://www.osti.gov/bridge/servlets/purl/958392-wkw7wE/958392.pdf">Finite Element Interface (FEI) group</a> is developing a high level abstraction and interface definition between (implicit) FE/FV codes and linear and nonlinear solver packages [FEI]. The <a href="http://www.cca-forum.org" target="_blank">Common  Component Architecture (CCA) Forum [CCA]</a> has developed a standard interface for the interactions between software components and frameworks that promotes &quot;plug and play&quot; experimentation. Moreover, this group has recently initiated an effort to define common interfaces for scientific data, including meshes and fields; collaboration with them in this area is an integral part of the proposed ITAPS center. However, the scope of the CCA effort is limited to providing interfaces to existing mesh technology. Our proposed work includes such interface definition development and goes beyond it, providing the additional functionality needed to create a truly interoperable environment for meshing and discretization.</p>
