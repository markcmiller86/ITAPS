<h1>Getting Started with ITAPS Software</h1>
        <p>ITAPS software is a continually growing suite of interoperable software products divided, conceptually, into three distinct categories;  integrated-Services, component-Services  and  interfaces.  Interfaces for mesh, geometry, fields and the relationships among them are the fundamental infrastructure necessary to create interoperable scientific computing software products. These interfaces are one of the key enabling technologies the ITAPS Center is responsible for developing and maintaining.</p>
        <p>In addition, the ITAPS Center is using the interfaces to componentize existing and new mesh and geometry tools to create component-services as well as integrating these products to create high-level  integrated-services.  We note that many of the tools in the ITAPS software suite exist in two forms; an ITAPS-compliant version and its Conventional counterpart which may or may not include the necessary wrappers to work with ITAPS interfaces.  We provide links only to the ITAPS-compliant versions of the software on these web pages; in most cases, the conventional versions are available for download from their home institutions or you may contact the ITAPS POC for more information.</p>
        <p>Lastly, and most importantly, for a targeted set of applications, the ITAPS Center provides direct, hands-on, customer support to end-user application developers who want to integrate ITAPS software products with their applications [contact <a href="mailto:diachin2@llnl.gov">Lori  Diachin</a> about this support]. The ITAPS software suite is the result of a collaboration of the interface design and integration expertise of the ITAPS Center with component developers in the broader scientific computing community.</p>
        <p>When getting ready to use ITAPS software for the first time, the first thing to consider what tools you are interested in using and how you are hoping to work with them. Typically, application software developers are interested in ITAPS software because they would like to incorporate functionality provided by integrated or component level services into their own application codes.  More information on usage strategies for application scientists can be found <a href="usage_strategies.html">here</a>.   In contrast, developers of pre- or post-processing tools who want to make their tools available to a wide community of users are interested in ITAPS  Interfaces. The list below briefly describes each of the three categories of ITAPS software and provides links to pages that describe software in that category in more detail as well as where current releases may be obtained.</p>
