<h1>The ITAPS Data Model</h1>

We use the information flow through a mesh-based simulation as the
framework for developing interoperable geometry, mesh and solution
field components.  A simulation's information flow begins with a
problem definition which consists of a description of the geometric
and temporal domain annotated by <italics> attributes </italics> designating
mathematical model details and parameters.  The geometric domain is
then often decomposed into a set of piecewise components, <it> the
mesh</it>, and the continuous PDEs is then approximated on that mesh
using, for example, finite difference or finite 
element techniques.  Simulation automation and reliability often imply
feedback of the PDE discretization information back to the domain
discretization (i.e. in adaptive methods) or even modification of the
physical domain or attributes (e.g., design optimization). <br>
<br>

Based on this model of information flow, ITAPS researchers have
defined an abstract data model that supports a wide array of
supporting technologies and encompasses a broad spectrum of usage
scenarios.  The data model divides the data required by a
simulation into three core data types: the <it>geometric data</it>, the
<it>mesh data</it>, and the <it>field data</it>.  These core data types are associated
with each other through <it> data relation managers</it>. The data
relation managers control the relationships among two or more of the
core data types, resolve cross references between entities in
different groups, and can provide additional functionality that
depends on multiple core data types.  The building blocks within these
data models are the concepts of <it>entities</it>, <it>entity sets</it>, and
<it> tags</it>.  <br>

<ul type="disc">

<li>
<it> Entities</it> are used to represent atomic pieces of information
such as a vertices in a mesh or edges in a geometric model.
Entity adjacency relationships define how the entities connect to
each other and both first-order and second-order adjacencies are
supported.</li> <br>

<li>
<it> Entity sets</it> are arbitrary collections of entities that may
be unordered or an ordered list.  The two primary supported
relationships among entity sets are <it> contained in</it> and <it>
parent/child</it> to allow for subsetting and hierarchical
applications. In addition, entity sets also have ''set operation''
capabilities such as set subtraction, intersection, or union. </li> <br>

<li>
<it> Tags</it> are used as containers to attach user-defined data to
ITAPS entities and entity sets.  Tags can be multi-valued which
implies that a given tag handle can be associated with many different
entities.  We support specialized tag types for improved performance
as well as the more general opaque case that allows any type of data
to be attached. </li> <br>
</ul>

As a particular example, consider the discrete representation of the
computational domain, or the mesh.  ITAPS <it> mesh entities</it>
correspond to the individual pieces of the mesh, namely, vertices,
edges, faces and regions.  Specific examples include a hexahedron,
edge, triangle or vertex.  Mesh entities are classified by their
entity type (topological dimension) and entity topology (shape).
Higher-dimensional entities are defined by lower-dimensional entities
with shape and orientation defined using canonical ordering
relationships.  To determine which adjacencies are supported by an
underlying implementation, an adjacency table is defined which can be
returned by a query through the interface.  The implementation can
report that adjacency information is always, sometimes, or never
available; and to be available at a cost that is constant, logarithmic
(i.e., tree search), or linear (i.e., search over all entities) in the
size of the mesh.  ITAPS <it> mesh entity sets</it> are extensively used
to collect mesh entities together in meaningful ways, for example, to
represent the set of all faces classified on a geometric face, or the
set of regions in a domain decomposition for parallel computing.
<br><br>

To support many of the services that applications desire, such as
adaptive mesh refinement, it is important that the data model include
the concept of modification to allow changes to geometry, topology, or
set structure.  In the case of the mesh, capabilities include changing
vertex coordinates and adding or deleting entities. Modification often
requires interactions between the mesh, geometry and field data models
and is one of the primary uses for the data relations manager. For
example, when refining a mesh, it is often critical to associate or
classify the mesh entity with one or more specific entities in the
underlying geometric model to ensure accuracy, particlarly on curved
or complex geometries.
