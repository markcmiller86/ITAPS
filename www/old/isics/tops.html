Toward Optimal Petascale Simulations (TOPS) ISIC</a><br />
PI: David Keyes (ODU), ITAPS Point of Contact: M. Shephard (RPI)</i></p>

<p>The solution of large-scale PDE problems typically leads to a large,
sparse linear or nonlinear algebraic system.  Dimensions easily range
into the hundreds of millions.  With the emergence of hierarchical
computing systems and inexpensive clusters this number will
dramatically rise in the next few years. Suboptimal algebraic solution
strategies can easily dominate the computational time and often mean
the difference between being able or not being able to solve a
problem.  Efficiency in a terascale environment is a must.
Fortunately, the TOPS ISIC is addressing these issues and developing
the optimal multiscale solution software and strategies needed for the
applications cited in this proposal and others intending to use our
mesh and discretization libraries.  This is an excellent opportunity
for cooperation and collaboration.  Reversing the perspective, the
meshing software, adaptive procedures, and discretization library to
be developed by this effort provide the TOPS ISIC with a source of
algebraic systems that will be obtained by the most advanced
technologies.</p>

<p>Initial interactions with TOPS have focused on a careful examination
of the latest version of PETSc (a key TOPS solver technology) and its
integration into Trellis. The integration into the new version of
Trellis has been carried out for fixed mesh analysis using the Trellis
DOF manager to coordinate the linkage with the overall global systems
and to provide the assembler with the mesh entity level
contributors. The contributors have been assembled into appropriate
PETSc structures for solution. Initial parallel analyses are underway
and efforts to ensure efficiency are beginning.</p>

<p>An examination of the issues surrounding the support of adaptive
calculations has been started by determining which PETSc structures
will best support such simulations. One natural selection is the
matrix free GMRES method. We plan to investigate the application of
the matrix free GMRES for an adaptive calculations. Efforts will then
begin on the long-term effort with TOPS developers to determine the
most effective methods to combine ITAPS adaptive mesh structures with
TOPS solvers.</p>

<p>
In addition, we are carefully following the definition of the TOPS
vector, matrix, and solver interfaces to ensure that the compatibility
of our discretization library.  These interfaces are still under
development (primarily at ANL) and we have attended several
meetings with TOPS scientists to discuss their development as it
relates to ITAPS functionality.</p>
