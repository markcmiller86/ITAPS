<h1>Introduction</h1>
<p><b><i> Our Vision. </i></b>
The advent of petascale computing will enable increasingly complex,
realistic simulations of PDE-based applications.  Numerous software
tools are available to help manage the complexity of these
simulations, including computer-aided design systems used to represent
the geometry of the computational domain, mesh generation tools to
discretize those domains, solution adaptive methods (AMR) to improve
the accuracy and efficiency of simulation techniques, and parallel
tools such as dynamic partitioning to ease implementation on today's
computer architectures.
These tools would be particularly effective if they could be easily
integrated and used in concert in existing simulations, or if they
could enable integration of existing simulations into multi-physics,
multi-scale codes.  At present, however, this type of integration is
exceedingly difficult, largely due to software compatibility issues
rather than underlying technical issues.
<it> So that numerical simulations can be constructed more efficiently using
the latest technologies, the Center for Interoperable Technologies for Advanced
Petascale Simulations (ITAPS) will develop interoperable and
interchangeable mesh, geometry, and field manipulation tools that are
of direct use to SciDAC applications.</it>  We are building on our successes
as the Terascale Simulations Tools and Technologies (TSTT) ISIC
funded during SciDAC-1, and we will develop new tools in
critical areas identified by SciDAC application teams.
</p>

<p><b><i> The Current State of Technology. </i></b>
In today's environment, there are many tools available that generate a
variety of mesh types ranging from unstructured meshes of various types
to overlapping structured meshes and hybrid meshes that include both
structured and unstructured components (for an extensive list, see <a href="http://www-users.informatik.rwth-aachen.de/%7Eroberts/meshgeneration.html">
Robert Schneiders' web page</a>). Approximation techniques used
on these meshes include finite difference (FD), finite volume (FV),
finite element (FE), spectral element (SE), and discontinuous Galerkin
(DG) methods. Any combination of these mesh and approximation types may
be used to solve PDE-based problems. The fundamental concepts are the
same for all approaches: some discrete representation of the geometry
(the mesh) is used to approximate the physical domain, and some
discretization procedure is used to represent approximate solutions and
differential operators on the mesh. In addition, the concepts of
adaptive mesh refinement for local resolution enhancement, time-varying
meshes to represent moving geometry, data transfer between different
meshes, and parallel decomposition of the mesh for computation on
advanced computers are the same regardless of their implementation. In
each case, the software tools providing these advanced capabilities are
becoming increasingly accepted by the scientific community, but their
application interfaces are not compatible. Thus interchanging
technology is often a labor intensive and error prone code modification
process that must be endured by the application scientist. This
typically results in a lengthy diversion from the central scientific
investigation and severely inhibits experimentation with improved mesh
and discretization technologies.</p>

<p><b><i>Research Goals.</i></b>
The premise of our technology development goal is that advanced mesh,
geometry and field services can be provided as libraries that can be
used with minimal intrusion into application codes.  During SciDAC-1,
the ITAPS team developed and deployed a number of advanced
technologies --- including the <it> Frontier-Lite</it> front tracking library,
the <it> Mesquite</it> mesh quality improvement toolkit,
along with unstructured mesh refinement and
swapping tools --- that provide ample evidence
of the viability of this approach.  Moreover, we combined these <it>
component services</it> in an interoperable way to provide new <it>
integrated services</it> such as AMR-front tracking, parallel adaptive
loop libraries, and combined geometry-mesh modification tools for use
in shape optimization applications.  Critical to the ITAPS
interoperability goal is the development of common interfaces that
provide data-structure-neutral access to mesh, geometry, and field
information.  These interfaces provide access to all ITAPS services in
a uniform way and are fundamental to creating interoperability for the
integrated services.  Moreover, a uniform interface allows easier
experimentation with different, but functionally similar, technologies
to determine which is best suited for a given application. The
development of such interfaces requires creating consensus among a
large group of mesh, geometry, and field experts; a difficult
technical and sociological challenge that would have been impossible
to achieve without the collaborative environment fostered by the
SciDAC program. It is this bringing together of a wide range of DOE and
university mesh-related technologies under a common interface that
distinguishes ITAPS as a center.
</p>

<p><b><i>Application Use of ITAPS Technologies.</i></b>
Figure 1 shows the two ways that applications can use
ITAPS services.  In the left figure (a), the application already has
geometry, mesh, and/or field data and implements the ITAPS interfaces
as wrapper functions around their own data structures.  Once the
necessary interface functions are implemented and tested, the ITAPS
services can easily access the application data they need through the
ITAPS interface.  In the right figure (b), the application scientist
can take advantage of data implementations already available from
ITAPS for rapid prototyping of new applications.  This mode of access
also allows easy access to ITAPS services using a very small number of
function calls to copy the necessary data to a fully compliant
implementation of the interface. In some cases the memory overhead
associated with the data copy is relatively small and this access mode
is sufficient for long term use. In other cases, it provides the
mechanism for easy access to and experimentation with ITAPS services;
as the benefits of the services become clear, application scientists
can implement the interfaces more efficiently based on their own data
structures.

services in application codes.  The figure on the left (a) shows the use of the
interfaces implemented directly on the application data structures.  The figure
on the right (b) shows the use of a reference implementation of the interfaces to
provide immediate access to ITAPS services at the cost of a data copy}

<p><b><i>Related Efforts.</i></b>
The time is ripe for such an effort in the area of meshing and
discretization technology. The existence of mature software tools in
these fields allows us to examine them, and their use in applications,
to extract the appropriate abstractions for developing common
interfaces at both high and low levels. We note that such
multi-institutional activities are underway in other scientific
domains. For example, the <a href="http://z.ca.sandia.gov/esi">Equation
Solver Interface (ESI) group [ESI]</a> is defining a set of
common interfaces for linear solvers and preconditioners and is
implementing them in a number of independently developed tools
including, e.g., PETSc, ISIS++, and Aztec. In a related effort, the <a href="http://z.ca.sandia.gov/fei">Finite Element Interface
(FEI) group</a> is developing a high level abstraction and
interface definition between (implicit) FE/FV codes and linear and
nonlinear solver packages [FEI]. The <a href="http://www.cca-forum.org">Common Component
Architecture (CCA) Forum [CCA]</a> has developed a standard
interface for the interactions between software components and
frameworks that promotes "plug and play" experimentation. Moreover,
this group has recently initiated an effort to define common interfaces
for scientific data, including meshes and fields; collaboration with
them in this area is an integral part of the proposed ITAPS center.
However, the scope of the CCA effort is limited to providing
interfaces to existing mesh technology. Our proposed work includes such
interface definition development and goes beyond it, providing the
additional functionality needed to create a truly interoperable
environment for meshing and discretization.</p>
