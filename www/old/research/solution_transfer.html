<h1>Solution Transfer Service</h1>

<p>
Adaptive and multi-physics applications both require the transfer of
solution data from one mesh to another.  This can be either local or
global in nature and must be supported on petascale computers. 

<p>There
are several ITAPS institutions developing functionality for various
parts of this problem.  For adaptive simulations, we provide field
transfer services during the execution of individual refinement,
collapse, and swap operations.  The solution transfer during interior
refinement maintains the field exactly, while the solution transfer
during collapse or swap is limited to only those elements in the small
cavity involved in the operation making it more effective to apply
alternative projection and/or conservation methods.  For multi-physics
applications, we provide solution transfers globally between distinct
meshes.  This process requires the evaluation of
field variables at particular target locations based on data
associated with the donor or source mesh. For each target location,
the solution transfer process must (i) identify the mesh entities in
the donor mesh from which data is required; (ii) determine the local
coordinates of the target point on the donor mesh entities; and (iii)
evaluate the required field components on the donor mesh at that
location. We have implemented solution
transfer based on a variety of local interpolation basis functions,
including linear, spherical harmonics, and higher-order spectral basis
functions.  These methods are used in various applications, including
climate modeling and multi-physics nuclear reactor simulation, use the
data sorting and searching component services, and provide an
important use case for development of the iField interface.

<p> Future efforts will consider
methods to satisfy conservation constraints, over cavities in
incremental solution transfer during parallel mesh adaptation and at
the end of a global solution transfer step during multi-physics
simulations.  Considering a variety of shape functions in these
diverse efforts will help guide discussions on the iField interface
and will provide a focal point for prototype implementations.
