<h1>ITAPS Research</h1>
<p>Research in the ITAPS center focuses on providing tools and
technologies to increase the levels of interoperability of mesh-based
methods for the analysis of PDEs and to fill specific technology gaps
needed to increase the level of automation and reliability of these
simulations. 
<p>
We are pursuing a balanced approach of developing (i) interfaces to
mesh-related data, (ii) services operating on those data, and (iii)
the development of higher-level combinations of these services for
specific applications.  The research in SciDAC-2 is
focused more toward the latter two areas, with a smaller effort on
interfaces still evolving from SciDAC-1. In all cases we will work
closely with the application teams
to ensure that the services are relevant to their
needs, are effectively deployed, and perform as expected.
<p>
The overall ITAPS research and development plan is summarized in the
image below.  The ITAPS center impacts many different application
areas through the development of integrated services that build on
multiple component services and common interfaces for geometry, mesh
and field information.  The application areas that we are
collaborating with rely on interoperability among various tools and
services delivered by ITAPS.  For example, consider accelerator
modeling.  In this case, integrated services that supply shape
optimization, petascale mesh generation and solution adaptive loops
are required to advance the state-of-the-art in accelerator cavity
modeling.  Each of these integrated services depends on multiple
component services. For example, the parallel solution adaptive loop
depends on the atomic operations for mesh refinement and coarsening in
the mesh <it>h</it>-adapt service as well as dynamic load balancing
tools.

<h3>Component Services</h3>
To support application needs, a number of component services must be
developed.  We will continue to develop critical tools for mesh
quality improvement, deforming meshes, and adaptivity (both front
tracking and h-refinement). In addition, we will develop new
services that focus on geometry access and manipulation, parallel data
services, interpolation, and r-adaptivity.

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><a href="./meshgeom.html">Interoperable Mesh/Geometry Technologies.</a>
Our emphasis is the creation of common interfaces for existing ITAPS
Center technologies that will allow them to interoperate with each
other to provide fundamentally increased capabilities and to allow
application scientists to easily switch among them. Our focus in the
first year has been on low-level query operations
for mesh access, the creation of CCA-compliant mesh components, and
demonstrations of ITAPS tool
interoperability on a one-to-one basis.</p>  </li>

  <li>
    <p><a href="./curve.html">Mesh Curve Correction</a> 
Building on our existing higher order mesh generation and modification
technologies, we have constructed a mesh curving service to construct
valid and well shaped curved elements.  </p></li>

    <p><a href="./mesquite.html">Mesh Smoothing</a>
We are creating a new,stand alone mesh quality improvement toolkit
that can be used with all ITAPS technologies. The primary aim of this
project is to provide a freely available, comprehensive software
package that would accommodate a number of different mesh element
types, quality metrics, and state-of-the-art topology modification and
node point movement algorithms.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
<p><a href="./swapping.html">Mesh Swapping.</a>&nbsp; Mesh swapping
improves the quality of unstructured simplicial meshes by changing the
local topology of the mesh.&nbsp; We have created an interoperable mesh
swapping tool that provides a full range of topological changes, in
conjunction with a variety of quality metrics, including user-defined
metrics.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
<p><a href="./adaptive-loops.html">Adaptive Loops.</a>&nbsp; Adaptive
methods are central to ensuring the reliability of the simulations
used for SciDAC applications. An area of emphasis of ITAPS has been the
development of an adaptive loop service that can be directly
integrated with SciDAC analysis procedures to provide adaptive
simulations that can greatly increase the reliability of the results
obtained.

</li>
  <li><p><a href="./frontier.html">Front Tracking.</a>&nbsp; 
We are developing a robust, accurate and efficient front tracking toolkit
library for computation of dynamically moving front. This library
can be loaded into any scientific application program which has the
need to track a moving interface. We provide functionality for
mathematical calculations with respect to the moving interface and
coupling tools to link the interface to the interior regions bounded
by the moving front.
<br>
  </li>
  <li>
<p>    <a href="./dynamic.html">Dynamic Services</a>&nbsp; 
We are developing the dynamic parallel data services, such as parallel 
partitioning, dynamic load balancing, data migration, unstructured communication 
maps, and geometrically-based processor searches, which are crucial 
to petascale performance of mesh-based simulations.
  </li>
  <li>
<p>    <a href="./visit_plugin.html">VisIt Plugins</a>&nbsp; 
Applications require the ability to visualize the data supported by the
ITAPS data model and interfaces.  We are developing plug-ins for the primary
delivery vehicle of the SciDAC VACET Center, VisIt, that allows a user
to visualization data from one or more ITAPS implementations.
  </li>
  <li>
<p>    <a href="./imeshio.html">iMesh IO</a>&nbsp; 
While the iMesh implementations have long been interchangeable once
the data was loaded into memory, the data load process itself was
specific to each implementation.   The iMeshIO service
addresses this by providing access to a wide variety of
scientific data via the iMesh interface.
  </li>

</ul>

<h3> Integrated Services </h3>
The component services described in the previous section can be used
directly by applications, e.g. geometric evaluation tools in
particle-in-cell applications and front tracking in fusion pellet
injection simulations.  However, these services can also be integrated
to form higher-level mesh-related services.  We propose
to extend some of these services, and construct new ones, as described
in the following links.

<ul>
  <li>
<p>    <a href="./petascale_meshing.html">Petascale Meshing</a>&nbsp; 
We will develop parallel unstructured mesh generation has as a way of
overcoming memory limitations of serial mesh generation for large
meshes on petascale architectures.
  </li>p
  <li>
<p>    <a href="./shape_opt.html">Shape Optimization</a>&nbsp; 
We are working to develop the mesh and geometry services needed to
for shape optimization simulations on deforming geometries.
  </li>
  <li>
<p> <a href="./par_adapt_loop.html">Parallel Adaptive Loop</a>&nbsp; A
parallel solution adaptive loop service is being developed to support
accelerator modeling and fuison MHD modeling that work in conjunction
with a CAD definition of the geometric domain so that as the mesh is
refined its geometric approximation is automatically improved.  
  </li>
<li>
<p>    <a href="./amr_front_tracking.html">AMR Front Tracking</a>&nbsp; 
We will continue to develop an adaptive front tracking technology and apply it
to applications in groundwater, astrophysics, and gas dynamics.
  </li>
  <li>
<p>    <a href="./solution_transfer.html">Solution Transfer</a>&nbsp; 
We will construct a parallel solution transfer service that transfers
field data from one mesh to another by integrating
ITAPS components for geometry and mesh sorting and searching,
interpolation kernels, and implementations of the geometry, mesh, and
fields interfaces.
  </li>
</ul>
