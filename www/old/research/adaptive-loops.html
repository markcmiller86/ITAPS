<h1>Adaptive Loops</h1>

The ITAPS Mesh Adaptation Service has been developed as a service that
can be directly integrated with SciDAC analysis procedures to provide
adaptive simulations which greatly increase the reliability of the
results obtained. The service that has been developed supports
generalized mesh adaptation by controlling the mesh to match the given
anisotropic mesh metric field defined on the previous mesh of the
domain of interest [1,5]. To ensure these methods work with general
curved geometries such as those commonly found in CAD representations,
the procedures build on a generalized interaction with the geometric
model [2] to ensure the mesh properly represents the domain of
interest [6]. Since these procedures fully account for the
interactions and representation with curved domains [10] they can be
extended to support adaptation in which high order spatial
discretizations are used [7]. Since the meshes needed by SciDAC
applications can be on the order of 100¡Çs of millions of elements, or
more, the mesh adaptation service can run in parallel using the same
partitioned mesh used by the solver [9,11].

An example of a CAD model and the different levels of mesh refinement
are shown in Figure 1. Note that the pictures in the bottom if Figure
1 are zoomed in to show the detail for the model and each mesh. Since
these procedures fully account for the interactions and representation
with curved domains they can be extended to support adaptation in
which high order spatial discretizations are used. </p>

<p>We have demonstrated that adaptive loop technology can be added to
existing fixed-grid finite element codes with little to no simulation
code modification (see <a
href="http://www.scorec.rpi.edu/cgi-bin/reports/Search3.pl?InputID=401">Shephard
et. al.</a> for more details). Examples include adaptive loops created
using Omega3P which is a fixed mesh simulation code developed at
Stanford Linear Accelerator Center and DEFORM which is a commercial
black-box fixed mesh simulation code.
