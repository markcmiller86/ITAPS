<h1>Petascale Mesh Generation</h1>

<p>
Parallel unstructured mesh generation has been proposed as a way of
overcoming memory limitations of serial mesh generation for large
meshes.  For example, modeling long-range
electro-magnetic effects in the International Linear Collider (ILC) in
SciDAC-2 will require meshes four to eight times the size of those
currently generated.  The use of larger meshes also routinely stresses
downstream capabilities like mesh partitioning for parallel analysis and
parallel IO.  In SciDAC-1, ITAPS researchers developed a prototype
CAD-based parallel mesh generation capability and demonstrated
superior performance and scaling for SLAC's NLC accelerator design.
We propose to upgrade this prototype to a production-class, scalable
parallel meshing capability.
<p>
In particular, we will update the tetrahedral meshing library used by
the current parallel meshing code, to take advantage of adaptive
sizing control and robustness improvements (both needed for meshing
the highly-curved ILC geometry).  We will link parallel mesh
generation with mesh partitioning and load balancing capabilities
to eliminate the reading and
writing of parallel mesh files.  We will also extend parallel geometry
IO in CGM to treat discrete or facet-based models, which will be
needed to represent higher-order geometry in accelerator and
front-tracking applications.
<p>
Applications such as combustion and
biological modeling place extra demands on the geometric models
supporting meshing, e.g. for moving boundaries and discrete
(facet-based) models.  Therefore we also propose to extend parallel
geometry IO in CGM to support these types of models, and to access
this capability through the ITAPS geometry interface.
