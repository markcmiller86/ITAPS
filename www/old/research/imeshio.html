<h1>iMeshIO Library</h1>

<p>
While the iMesh implementations were previously interchangeable once
the data was loaded into memory, the data load process itself was
specific to each implementation implying that
a file written by one implementation would not necessarily be
accessible to a different implementation.  The iMeshIO service
addresses this need by providing access to a wide variety of
scientific data via the iMesh interface.  We are leveraging the VisIt
database plugin readers which allow users to read scientific data from
any of 100+ file formats and instantiate that data in an iMesh
implementation.  The essential first step in developing iMeshIO was to
develop a write capability for VisIt's ITAPS database plugin. This
writer supports basic features of the iMesh interface including basic
mesh topology and geometry as well as fields stored as dense tags. It
does not yet support advanced set hierarchies, sparse tags or iMeshP.
The ITAPS writer has been tested with the MOAB, GRUMMP, and FMDB
implementations of iMesh.
An early alpha release of iMeshIO was recently completed.
With it, we recently demonstrated the ability to instantiate data from a
previously unsupported file type in an iMesh implementation using
iMeshIO, use an ITAPS service such as iZoltan to decompose the data
for parallel computations, and visualize the results using VisIt.
