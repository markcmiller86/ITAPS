<h1>Mesh Curving Service</h1>

<p>High-order finite element methods applied to curved domains require
the use of properly curved elements. A common approach to the
construction of such meshes is to apply straight-sided mesh generation
and to then curve the mesh edges and faces on curved domain boundaries
to the proper order by simply moving nodes. The problem with this
procedure is a number of elements typically become invalid (negative
determinant of the Jacobian over a portion of the element). Building
on our existing higher order mesh generation and modification
technologies we have, at the request of SciDAC applications,
constructed a mesh curving service to construct valid and well shaped
curved elements.
</p>

<p>The mesh curving service can accept two types of input meshes. The
first would be a curved mesh of second order curved simplex elements
where some of the elements are invalid. In this case the procedure
performs mesh modifications to make valid elements while maintaining
the nodes placed on the curved geometries. The second is a valid
straight-sided mesh, its related geometric model and the association
of mesh edges and faces on the boundary of the domain with the model
faces and edges they are on. Currently Parasolid, Acis, SolidWorks,
and OpenCascade modeler etc. are supported for the geometric models.
</p>

<p>The mesh curving service applies Bezier polynomials internally to
represent the mesh geometry and performes local mesh modification
operation in an incremental manner to correct the invalid elements
[1]. In the situation where the given mesh uses different shape
representation method, the conversion between the original
representation method and the Bezier method is processed before and
after applying the tool.  The mesh region validity check takes
advantage of the bounding property of the Bezier polynomials which
ensures that the determinant of Jacobian of the element in its closure
is always positive and is independent of the chosen integration scheme
in the high order finite element method. The curved local mesh
modifications are applied in a specific order that can effectively
eliminate the invalid curved elements and make the resulting mesh
valid [1]. The operations are built upon a set of operations including
collapse, split, swap, and shape modifications. </p>

<p>The mesh curving service has been successfully applied to curvilinear
meshes being simulated by the Stanford Linear Accelerator Center
(SLAC) in the large-scale electromagnetic modeling. The valid
curvilinear meshes not only make the time-domain simulations stable
but also make the execution time up to 30% faster due to better
condition matrices. Examples are shown below.

model next generation accelerators require that the meshes also be
curved to achieve high accuracy.  We have developed automatic
procedures to locate and correct inverted elements which significantly
