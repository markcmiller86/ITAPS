<h1>ITAPS Component Services</h1>

<p> Several mesh and geometry component services have been
developed that are useful to applications in their own right and can also
used as building blocks by integrated services.  We give an overview
of several of the services that have seen the most development to date.
More information can be obtained by following the links to the left.

</p><p> <i> <b><a href="mesquite.html"> Mesh Quality Improvement</a>.</b> </i>&nbsp;Mesh quality is critical for
obtaining optimal efficiency and accuracy in numerical simulations.
The Mesh Quality Improvement Toolkit (<a href="http://www.cs.sandia.gov/optimization/knupp/Mesquite.html">Mesquite</a>) is a highly
flexible, efficient, and comprehensive software package that
incorporates state-of-the-art algorithms to optimize the shape of mesh
elements by relocating vertices in both two and three dimensions.
Close collaborations with the 
<a href="http://www.scalablesolvers.org/">TOPS center</a> has resulted in a
new feasible Newton solver for Mesquite that can find the optimal
location of millions of vertices in just a few minutes \cite{FeasNewt}.
Mesquite interactions with SciDAC-1 applications include: updating
meshes on deforming geometry for the SLAC design optimization effort, improvement of hybrid and unstructured
meshes in several meshing codes (Cubit, Overture, NWGrid, GRUMMP), and
smoothing of geodesic meshes in support of the SciDAC climate group at
CSU.  In addition, Mesquite has been used in many non-SciDAC
applications including smoothing of arteriovenous graft meshes, Alegra ALE rezone, and CSAR propellant burn.  The
code has been released as open source&nbsp;and
downloaded over 400 times in the past two years.

</p><p> <i> <b><a href="frontier.html">Front Tracking</a>.</b></i>  
Front tracking can significantly improve
the accuracy of simulations which have sharply defined moving surfaces
of discontinuity.  These surfaces are given explicit computational
degrees of freedom, supplementing the continuous solution values at
regular grid points. Our method uses the locally grid-based method
which
employs an accurate Lagrangian algorithm for front propagation but adopts
the boxed Eulerian reconstruction for topological
bifurcation. This method is both accurate and robust
and was found to be the best of
several methods tested, including level sets and volume of fluids
\cite{DuFixGli05}.  During SciDAC-1, the front tracking algorithms
implemented in {\sl FronTierLite} underwent several important
innovations and was modularized into a physics-independent scientific
software package. In addition, a conservative scheme was implemented
in all dimensions; its efficiency is still to be tuned.  The
FronTierLite code has been used in many application areas including
the simulation of the diesel jet injection, the study of the fluid
mixing, the MHD simulation of fusion pellet injection, target design 
for advanced accelerators, and the
simulation of type Ia supernova.  
<a href="frontier.html">FronTierLite</a> is now in
public release, with over 1000 hits per month and 10's of downloads
per month.

</p><p> <a href="swapping.html"><i> <b>Mesh Swapping</b></i></a>.  Mesh swapping improves the quality of 
unstructured meshes by changing the local topology of the mesh.
This technique is
especially helpful in three dimensions, where the combination of
swapping and vertex relocation has been shown to dramatically improve
mesh quality and simulation efficiency
\cite{frei-cfog:ijnme97,fo-g:cost-benefit}.  As part of SciDAC-1, a
state-of-the-art swapping algorithm \cite{grummp} was re-implemented
as a stand-alone library using the mesh and geometry interfaces
\cite{tstt-swap-tool}.  In two dimensions, edge swapping is supported,
while in three dimensions, both edge and face swapping are supported.
In addition, users can define their own mesh quality metrics, allowing
great flexibility in usage.  This swapping software is already in use in
one widely-distributed SciDAC meshing code (<a href="http://tetra.mech.ubc.ca/GRUMMP">GRUMMP</a>), which
is used in numerous non-SciDAC applications in fluid and solid
mechanics, medicine, and astrophysics, with over 500 downloads per year.

</p><p> <i> <b><a href="adaptive-loops.html">Unstructured Mesh <i>h</i>-Adaptation</a>.</b></i>
The mesh adaptation service modifies a given input mesh to be
consistent with a specified target mesh size field.  That is,
refinement and coarsening operators are applied to tetrahedral mesh
elements until they match the specified target sizes
\cite{shep05,wan05} which can include anisotropic \cite{li04,li05} mesh configurations. 
These procedures have been developed to work in conjunction with a CAD
definition of the geometric domain so that as the mesh is refined its
geometric approximation is automatically improved \cite{li05,shep05}.
A preliminary version of this service has been used in the accelerator
and fusion application areas and has recently been made available
through the <a href="../software/download_services.html">ITAPS software web site</a>.

</p><p> <i> <b>Support for Distributed Meshes.</b></i>
Many of the SciDAC applications require ITAPS services operate on
meshes that are distributed over the processors of a parallel
computer. To meet these needs, the ITAPS team has developed two tools
that support distributed mesh operations. The first is a parallel mesh
generation process that distributes a
CAD model over multiple processors allowing each processor to mesh
surfaces and volumes in parallel yielding a valid
conforming mesh of the entire domain. The second tool is the addition
of a partition model and parallel mesh migration procedures to our
flexible mesh database (<a href="http://gforge.scorec.rpi.edu/projects/fmdb">FMDB</a>)&nbsp; to support
dynamic load balancing in the parallel adaptive loops service.  Both
of the distributed mesh support tools have been used on the SLAC
accelerator modeling project. The parallel partitioning and migration
are part of FMDB which is available for <a href="../software/download_interfaces.html">download</a>.
