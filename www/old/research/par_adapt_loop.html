<h1>Parallel Adaptive Loops</h1>

A parallel solution adaptive loop service is being developed to support SLAC
accelerator modeling and PPPL MHD modeling
of fusion plasmas (currently underway), and is also being applied to
blood flow and large deformation forming
problems. The current service is based on generalized
mesh modification procedures that accept a discretized mesh size field
as input and modifies simplex (tetrahedral) meshes to match the
specified mesh sizes including anisotropic
mesh configurations. These procedures have been
developed to work in conjunction with a CAD definition of the
geometric domain so that as the mesh is refined its geometric
approximation is automatically improved.  A
generalized partition model has been added to this
service to allow it to support parallel distributed meshes that are
dynamically load-balanced as part of adaptive simulations.  

<p>
We will continue to develop this service
to provide applications the ability to
employ adaptive simulation technologies with either no modification,
or minimal modification, to their analysis procedures. The minimal set
of components required to construct an adaptive loop are (i) a
mesh-based analysis procedure capable of solving the PDE's, (ii) an
error estimation procedure that can use the current solution
information to indicate the changes desired to the discretization,
(iii) a mesh adaptation procedure (which must be geometry-aware) that
can modify the mesh as specified and (iv) a procedure to map solution
parameters to the new discretization. This service will build on
component services for mesh adaptation, error estimation, solution
transfer, and dynamic services, as well as the ITAPS interfaces.  We
will also complete the parallelization of this service, to eliminate
the serial I/O bottleneck of the current process, with a goal of
improving the scalability of the current service to treat meshes of
over 10^9 elements.
