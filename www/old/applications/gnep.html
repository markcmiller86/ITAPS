<h1>Nuclear Reactor Simulation</h1>
<p>
Nuclear energy can play a key role in securing the energy independence
of the United States by offering a clean, safe alternative to
traditional fossil fuel energy production. Simulation and modeling
will play a key role in the development of next generation nuclear
reactors to improve their design, implementation and operation. The
physics associated with these systems operate in very complex
geometrical domains and will benefit from the tools and technologies
developed by ITAPS. We are involved in several collaborations whose
goals are to develop and deploy high-performance computing tools for
coupled multi-scale simulations of the sodium fast reactor.

The geometries of reactor cores can be quite complex and require
scalable geometry and mesh generation tools. For example, the 217-pin
fuel assembly shown in the figure below uses a conformal hexahedral
mesh
for the 1520 geometrical volumes. Each fuel pin is wrapped with a thin
wire the small scale of which significantly complicates the mesh
generation process. </p>

<br />
<p>
Once the mesh is generated, the physics that is
modeled is a combination of thermal hydraulics, structural mechanics,
and neutronics. A different simulation tool is used for each of these
physical processes, but there is a strong need for them to interact
with and exchange data with each other. The SHARP framework being
developed at Argonne National Laboratory provides the infrastructure
necessary to do this coupling on large-scale computer architectures.
ITAPS technology is used as the basis of the SHARP
reactor simulation project and the common ITAPS interfaces simplify
the coupling between thermal/hydraulics and neutronics physics
modules. These interfaces and the ITAPS approach in general also serve
as a means for collaborating with other institutions and for coupling
with commercial codes.

<h2>Nuclear Reactor Core Geometry and Mesh Generation</h2>

Generating geometric models and meshes for reactor cores can be a
tedious and error-prone process, despite the high degree of repeated
structures commonly found in these models.&nbsp; The Reactor Geometry
Generator (RGG) tool has been developed, based on ITAPS technologies,
that takes advantage of these repeated structures to simplify
specification of geometry and mesh parameters.<br />
<br />
<span style="font-style: italic;">Figure: RGG process execution,
showing the various steps and input files.</span><br />
<img style="width: 511px; height: 383px;" alt="RGG process" src="../graphics/rgg_process.jpg" align="left" />RGG works in 3
phases, depicted in the figure to the left:<br />
<ol>
  <li>A text file is read by the AssyGen code, which generates a
geometric model along with a meshing script suitable as input to the
CUBIT mesh generation toolkit.</li>
  <li>The assembly model is meshed, by running CUBIT on the meshing
script produced by AssyGen, or using a customized approach.</li>
  <li>The
CoreGen tool reads individual assembly meshes, copy/moves them into the
core lattice based on input in another text file, then merges
coincident mesh vertices.</li>
</ol>
The resulting mesh can be either 2D or 3D.&nbsp; By default, AssyGen
produces meshing commands to mesh the assemblies with quad/hex
elements, though the user is free to substitute their own meshing
procedure for each assembly.&nbsp; A variety of unit cell types can be
specified for assembly models, including ones where a large central
unit cell covers neighboring unit cells, e.g. for modeling central
control rod guide tubes.<br />
<br />
Since geometric models are only produced for each assembly instance,
generating a mesh for whole-core models is much more efficient (in both
memory and time) than doing the entire process in a meshing tool like
CUBIT.&nbsp; For example, RGG generated the 12 million element hex mesh
shown in the figure in under 30 minutes on a desktop workstation using
less than 6 GB of memory.<br />

generation library.<br />

<h2>Coupled Neutronics, Thermal Analysis for ATR Experiments</h2>

The Advanced Test Reactor (ATR) at Idaho National Laboratory is used to
test advanced reactor materials in a high-radiation environment.&nbsp;
Some test materials include Uranium and other fissile material, and can
generate considerable heat while resident in the ATR core.&nbsp; For
these experiments it is important to evaluate the cooling requirements
and the expected structural response, to make sure the experiments are
maintained in a safe condition and do not threaten the safety of ATR
itself.&nbsp; Neutron heating is computed using the DAG-MCNP5 Monte
Carlo code, with results tallied on a cylindrical mesh.&nbsp; These
results are transferred to a body-fitted finite element hexahedral
mesh, which is input to the Abaqus finite element code for structural
mechanics and heat transfer analysis.<br />
<br />
ITAPS tools are used in many phases of this analysis.&nbsp; The
DAG-MCNP5 code evaluates particle transport by performing ray-tracing
on a facet-based model derived from CAD geometry.&nbsp; Geometry is
read using the CGM library; the geometric topology of this model is
read into MOAB and represented using entity sets, with edge and face
facets also represented for model edges and faces.&nbsp; This model
forms the basis for ray-tracing, which uses MOAB's hierarchical
Oriented Bounding Box tree for improved efficiency.&nbsp; The
cylindrical mesh storing DAG-MCNP5 radiation heating and the
body-fitted Abaqus mesh are both read into MOAB, and heating results
are mapped from one mesh to the other using MOAB's kdTree for point
location between meshes.&nbsp; Some of the visualizations used in this
process used the VisIt package with the ITAPS iMesh plugin.<br />

<h2>Multiphase flow for accident scenarios</h2>

<p><i>ITAPS Personnel</i>: Ken Jansen (RPI), Roman Samulyak (BNL), Jim
Glimm (BNL) </p>
<p><i>Nuclear Energy Personnel</i>: Michael Podowski (RPI) </p>
<p><i>Project Status</i>: Active </p>
<p>The overall purpose of this collaboration is to deploy advanced
simulation capabilities for next generation reactor systems utilizing
newly available, high-performance computing facilities. The goals are
1) to develop and deploy high-performance computing tools for coupled
thermal-hydraulic, neutronic, and materials multi-scale simulations of
the sodium fast reactor (SFR) and 2) apply the new computational
methodology to study reactor fuel and core transient response under
beyond-design and accident conditions. </p>
<p>The work will encompass a broad spectrum of issues that are
critical for developing next-generation reactors. Deliverables will
include multi-physics, multi-scale computational modeling capabilities
to investigate the impact of long-term thermal and mechanical loads
and high-burnup fuel on reactor safety and accident mitigation
strategies. The consortium will address three major groups of
problems: 1) development of new simulation capabilities for
state-of-the-art computer codes (FronTier, PHASTA, and NPHASE) coupled
with MD-type analysis, 2) development of advanced numerical solvers
for massive parallel computing, and 3) deployment of a multiple-code
computational platform for the Blue Gene supercomputer simulations of
SFR fuel performance during accidents. </p>
<p>Researchers will use the simulation codes to study fuel
performance, including molecular-scale fission product release from
ceramic fuel material, local core degradation, and fission
product/fuel particle transport and release in the reactor core. Since
no single computer code or technology level can be expected to cover
such a broad range of design and operation issues during the reactor's
lifetime, it is anticipated that the proposed suite of tools will
dramatically improve the accuracy and efficiency of reactor
simulations. This, in turn, will significantly reduce conservative
design and safety margins that are inherently associated with current
reactor engineering methods.</p>

<p>The NPHASE, PHASTA and FronTier codes are well suited to form the
basis of a multidimensional, multifield and multiscale simulation
capability. The NPHASE code is robust finite volume solver for the
simulation of ensemble averaged time-dependent two-phase flows. PHASTA
is a finite element, time-accurate computer code using single phase
and level-set tracking methods. FronTier is a multiphysics code for
the simulation of multiphase/free surface flows based on the explicit
tracking of material interfaces. To enhance and optimize the
performance of these three codes on massively parallel supercomputers,
state-of-the-art multilevel solvers software for nonlinear partial
differential equations will be used, developed at Columbia University.
</p>
<h3>ITAPS related software</h3>
<i>FronTier Code</i>
<p> FronTier, a multiphysics code for the
simulation of multiphase / free surface flows based on the method of
front tracking has been developed at Stony Brook University
in collaboration with BNL and LANL. Front tracking is a
numerical method in which surfaces of discontinuity are given explicit
computational degrees of freedom, supplementing the continuous
solution values at regular grid points. FronTier has been tested on
multi-material, multi-physics
problems using massively parallel supercomputers, and used for
simulations of turbulent fluid mixing, design of liquid mercury
targets for future advances accelerators, pellet fuelling of
thermonuclear fusion reactors, and astrophysical
studies. </p>
<p>The FronTier research will be focused in the
following major directions: </p>
<ul>
  <li> The
development of new capabilities of the FronTier code to enable
simulations of
the fuel rod failure during severe accidents in Liquid Metal Fast
Rectors. New
phase transition models for the fuel melting and vaporization will be
developed
as well as models fpor the formation and evolution of cracks in the
solid fuel
cladding. FronTier will simulate the creation of a melt volume within
the fuel
rod, release of volatile fission products and the subsequent rise in
melt
volume pressure, growth of the melt volume, the clad failure and debris
ejection into the coolant channel.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li>The modeling and simulations of the injection of
fission products from the failed fuel rod into liquid coolant and the
injection
of liquid coolant into the inside of fuel elements. The interface with
the
NPHASE and PHASTA codes will also be developed for the data exchange
purpose.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li>FronTier
will provide new closure models for multiphase systems and benchmark
with
existing averaged models of NPHASE through direct numerical simulations
at
microscale.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li>The development of geometrical interface
tracking capabilities to NPHASE and PHASTA codes, and the multiple code
platform. Explicit interface tracking will increase capabilities of
NPHASE and
PHASTA to simulate complex multiphase flows. We will leverage the
development
of the geometrical front tracking package FronTier-Lite within the
SciDAC ITAPS
collaboration, and provide interfaces for its use in both single and
coupled
code simulations. </li>
</ul>
<i>Massively Parallel Anisotropic Mesh Adaptivity
Enables PHASTA Code </i>
<p>PHASTA is a parallel, hierarchic (higher order accurate from
2nd-5th order accurate depending on function choice), adaptive,
stabilized (finite element) transient analysis&nbsp;flow solver (both
incompressible and compressible) that has been developed at RPI. This
approach has been shown by Karanam et. al. [2007], Whiting
et. al. [2003], Whiting and Jansen [2001] and Jansen [1999] to be an
effective tool for bridging a broad range of length scales in
turbulent (RANS, LES, DES, DNS) flows. PHASTA (and its predecessor
ENSA) was the first unstructured grid LES code [Jansen, 1993; Jansen,
1994; and Jansen, 1999] and has been applied to turbulent flows
ranging from validation benchmarks (channel flow, decay of isotropic
turbulence) to complex flows (airfoils at maximum lift, flow over a
cavity, near lip jet engine flows and fin-tube heat exchangers). It
has also developed advanced anisotropic adaptive algorithms [Sahni et
al., 2006,2007; Mueller et al., 2005; Shephard et al., 2005] and the
most advanced LES/DES models [Hughes et al. 2000, Martinez and Jansen,
2000, 2003, 2004, 2005a and 2005b]. Note that DES, LES, and DNS are
computationally intensive even for single phase flows.&nbsp; We have
recently [Nagrath et al., 2006; Nagrath et al., 2005] extended this
capability to two phase flows where we use the level set method to
track the boundary between two immiscible fluids (either compressible
where we captured new instabilities in sonoluminescence or
incompressible where we studied bubble coalescence and two-phase
turbulence including ongoing studies of turbulent annular flow and
water jet air entrainment). Making simulations this complex grid
independent, while ambitious, is reasonable with available
computational resources due the efficient use of anisotropically
adapted unstructured grids and highly scalable performance on
massively parallel computers (the code has shown perfect scaling out
to 32k IBM Blue Gene processors (largest available for testing)). An
example of PHASTA's current two-phase flow modeling is shown in the
figure below where an annular flow (blue is liquid, red is gas, 30
degree sector is modeled) is initiated with an unstable wave which
grows, breaks and forms droplets (surface shown is the phase interface
which is colored by local speed).</p>
