<h1>Applications Impact</h1>

<p>The goal of the ITAPS Center is to develop and deploy a set of
computational tools that will significantly and positively impact the
ability of scientific applications researchers to employ advanced
mesh and geometry-based simulation technology in their research.
Because of the sophistication of most existing advanced tools in this
area, their availability has until now been limited to only the most
ambitious application developers.  We are addressing this deficiency by
offering significant capability for generating different kinds of
meshes for complex geometry and employing these meshes in scientific
simulations through easy-to-use application-appropriate interfaces.
Since many important Office of Science applications are characterized
by strongly non-uniform solution features, these tools will include
capabilities for solution-adaptive mesh and solution improvement
capabilities, including mesh refinement and front tracking.
</p>

<p>We have invested a significant portion of our resources in meeting with
scientists from many of the SciDAC application areas, analyzing their
needs for advanced meshing and discretization technologies, and
working with them to demonstrate the promise of such techniques in
their application domains.  We highlight the positive impact we have
had on applications researchers here.  More information on these interactions
can be found by following the links.</p>

<h2> Impact on SciDAC Applications </h2>

<ul>
<li>
<i><a href="https://compass.fnal.gov">Community Petascale Project for Accelerator Science and Simulation (COMPASS)</a>.</i> 
The ITAPS team supported significant accelerator
modeling achievements in several areas.

<ul>
<p>
</p><li>ITAPS enabled the first-ever Tau3P transit beam simulation of the
Stanford Linear Accelerator Center (SLAC) PEP-II device, supporting a
15% increase in beam current in the upgraded device by providing
high-quality hexahedral meshes.  Similar mesh generation
efforts for the advanced Damped Detuned Structure (DDS) resulted in
the first wakefield analysis of an actual DDS prototype and the direct
verification of DDS wakefield suppression by end-to-end simulation.
</li>

<p>
</p><li> ITAPS researchers teamed with SLAC scientists to improve by
an order of magnitude the accuracy of predicted field quantities that
influence wall losses in the Rare Isotope Accelerator device. To accomplish this ITAPS researchers provided
an adaptive simulation capability with error indicators, field
function libraries, and mesh modification procedures.
These
procedures are being extended to effectively operate in parallel to
support full-scale accelerator systems.
</li>

<p>
</p><li> A collaboration between ``Toward Optimal Petascale Simulations'' (TOPS),
ITAPS, and SLAC researchers is providing automatic tuning of
accelerator geometries to significantly increase the speed and
decrease the cost by which new accelerators can be designed.  ITAPS researchers provide services for varying
design geometry, smoothing the mesh onto new models, and automatically
computing sensitivities of the mesh with respect to design parameters.

<i><a href="http://w3.pppl.gov/cemm">Center for Extended Magnetohydrodynamic Modeling (CEMM)</a>.</i>
ITAPS researchers are contributing to a new effort at Princeton Plasma
Physics Lab (PPPL) to develop
an adaptive, high-order finite element discretization for their new
M3D-C1 code.  Solutions of the CEMM challenge problems
developed by ITAPS researchers using high-order spectral element
technologies
elements that focused on the case of anisotropic diffusion led to the
conclusion that a small number of higher-order elements significantly
decreased the total solution time needed to obtain a given
accuracy.  Ongoing work focuses on insertion of
adaptive mesh refinement technologies and error estimators directly
into the new code.

<i>Virtual Microbial Cell Simulator (VMCS)</i>.  ITAPS mesh
generation and discretization technologies were used in simulations
that provided new scientific insight into the flocculation behavior of
Shewanella microbes in oxygen rich environments by confirming that
there is an oxygen gradient from the edges of the floc into the center.  This collaboration with PNNL computational biologists
has resulted in the development of the VMCS&nbsp; which is targeting DOE bioremediation problems in heavy metal
waste.

<a href="http://www.scidac.gov/CCSM"><i>Collaborative Design and Development of the Community Climate
Model.</i></a>  ITAPS researchers, in collaboration with climate scientists
at ORNL, improved the prediction of rainfall, snowfall and cloud
cover in regional weather models in prototype simulations for an
atmospheric pulse rotating around the Earth.  ITAPS provided the enhanced mesh
generation and discretization capabilities for anisotropic planar and
geodesic surface meshes that helped enable this result.  The initial
mesh is adapted and optimized to capture land surface orographic or
topographic height fields for these simulations.

the potential impact of high-order discretization methods for both the
hydrodynamics and neutrino transport aspects of their simulations.  In
both cases, adaptive Discontinuous Galerkin discretizations were
implemented for the appropriate test problems and comparison to the
currently used techniques shows that a significant benefit in terms of
accuracy and time to solution can be obtained by using these
techniques.

<i> Combustion.</i>  ITAPS researchers developed simulation tools
that provide a new predictive capability for diesel engine design that
emphasizes the modeling of the instability and break up of a diesel
jet into spray.  This simulation highlighted the
advantages of front tracking algorithms combined with two-dimensional
structured adaptive mesh refinement.
