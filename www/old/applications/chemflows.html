<p><b>Diesel Jet Spray Formation</b></p>

<p> ITAPS members at BNL and SUNY SB have been working with scientists at
Argonne to create a simulation code that models spray formation in
diesel jet break up.  This is an important aspect of the problem as it
provides input to spray combustion models and is critical for
predictive modeling of bio-diesel engine combustion.  The overall goal of
such an effort is the design of a nonpolluting, fuel-efficient engine.  
The flow geometry is shown in Figure 1.</p>

<p>Spray formation is a difficult problem for simulation due to</p>

<ul>
	<li> the geometric complexity and multiscale nature of the spray, </li>
	<li> the stiff equation of state (EOS) for diesel fuel, and the need to model cavitations, phase transitions, shock waves and other strong hydrodynamic transients, </li>
	<li> the limited resolution of experimental diagnostics, and </li>
	<li> the sensitive dependence of spray formation on nozzle geometry and other problem parameters. </li>
</ul>

<p> To model this process, we are using a 2D compressible fluid code,
FronTier which has a high quality interface capability that enables
multiscale resolution of complex geometries. Through our study, we
have found that the formation of cavitation vapor bubbles is the key
phenomena contributing to the breakup. We have developed a three scale
hetrogeneous EOS model consisting of explicitly tracked cavitation
vapor bubbles within the liquid diesel fuel for the mixed phase
(diesel vapor/liquid) regime for cavitations in the nozzle and
atomization, in the regime of a high speed jet. This appears to be the
first calculation of this nature, and in this high speed atomization
parameter regime.</p>

<p>The three scales we study are a thermal diffusion boundary layer (nm)
at the edge of the cavitation bubbles, and regulating the rate of phase
transition on the bubble wall, the bubble diameter, on the scale of
microns, and the device (nozzle and combustion chamber) on the scale of cm. </p>

<p>New developments supported by ITAPS required to make this simulation
a success include: AMR (from code merger with Overture), a phase
transition module and Riemann solver, and a numerical model for the
initiation of a tracked bubble, inserted when the pressure is less than
a critical (tension) value. </p>

<p>The major conclusion is that a multiscale model has been able to
achieve agreement with quantitative macroscale flow parameters such as
spray opening angle and spray volume fraction or density, and as a
qualitative measure of agreement with experiment, the occurrence of
spray formation. See Figure 2.</p>

<p>The current work is mainly focused on the simulation of the two-phase
mixture resulting from cavitation. The influence of other parameters
on spray formation is a subject of further research.</p>
