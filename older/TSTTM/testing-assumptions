Should output arrays have the same indexing as incoming arrays?

A minor assumption in checking how entityGetAdjacencies behaves with bad
input: that no implementation will categorically reject calls for
vertices adjacent to a set of entities.  This should never be a problem,
except perhaps if the database contains -only- vertices.

Need to add canonical ordering checks.
