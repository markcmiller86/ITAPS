\section{Introduction}
\input{intro}

%\begin{verbatim}
%1. Introduction
% - Motivation: there is a significant effort devoted to the development
%   of PDE solvers
%    - often this effort is somewhat peripheral to the main goals at
%      hand; that is the development of a new physics solver
%    - could be more effective if tools for the peripheral parts were
%      available for incorporation
%    - such tools would include automated meshing from general problem 
%      definitions, adaptive methods, multi-physics techniques
%
% - Even when they exist, simulation codes find it difficult to take 
%   advantage of these tools because of the current status of tool availability:
%    - libraries:
%        - typically focused; limited API options for accessing library
%          functionality
%        - difficult to experiment with different libraries that provide
%          similar capabilities (API is library specific)
%        - often don't interoperate with other libraries that provide 
%          related capabilities
%        - language interoperability often sketchy
%        - examples include F,G
%    - frameworks:
%        - typically impose structure on application code; reasonable
%          for new application development, but often difficult to rewrite
%          existing codes to conform
%        - simulation codes need to buy into the entire framework to use
%          the parts of most interest to them
%        - examples include X,Y
%
% - New work in scientific community focuses on the development of components 
%   which addresses some of the short comings of library or framework approaches
%    - Define a component (a software object meant to interact with other
%       components, encapsulating a certain functionality, clearly defined
%       interface and comforms to a prescribed behavior common to all components
%       in an architecture)
%    - Key: define a common API, multiple implementations/services that conform
%    - Useful in the following cases
%        - where there is a specialized analysis engine that cannot be easily 
%          reworked into a framework code and that requires multiple, related 
%          functionalities (perhaps provided by incompatible libraries)
%        - where experimentation with different techniques is of interest
%          (plug and play)
%        - where dynamic access to different, related services is required
%    - Other examples of work in this area
%        - CCA, solvers, etc
%    - TSTT work focuses on mesh/geometry/field tools - the focus of this paper

\section{Information Flow in Mesh-based simulation}
\input{simulation}

%\begin{verbatim}
%  - Gives the overview of PDE simulation steps - based on the general 
%    discretization docuement from last summer (Mark, can you send that out again?)
%  - Assumptions and definitions
%      - Mesh:  high level view of data model, functionality expected
%      - Geom:  high level view of data model, functionality expected
%      - Field: high level view of data model, functionality expected
%      - Others?
%  - How they are related to each other
