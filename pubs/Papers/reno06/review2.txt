Each of the following categories was rated on a scale from 1 to 7 with 1
being on the low end and 7 being on the high end.

Originality: 	3

The paper does not explain clearly which aspects of the proposed
interface are new and original.

Significance: 	4

Relevance to the IMR: 	5

Not much of the content of the paper discusses specific and unique
aspects of developing such an interface for mesh and geometry data
processing. (This type of language-independent interface would be useful
for many areas of computer code development, sharing, and re-use.)

Comments to the Authors

Main Contributions

The paper describes a language-independent interface for mesh and
geometry data processing. It also shows how to use the proposed
interface with simple examples.

Positive Aspects

- The paper proposes an approach to addressing a common difficulty in
large-scale, multi-team software development.
- The paper is easy to read.

Negative Aspects

- The paper reads more like a software manual than an academic paper.
- The paper does not explain clearly which aspects of the proposed
interface are new and original.
- The work is still on-going and evolving.

Further Comments

- This type of language-independent interface would be useful for
general computer code development, sharing, and re-use. However, the
authors should focus more on the specific and unique aspects of
developing such an interface for mesh and geometry data processing.
- Check the reference in the last sentence of Section 2.3.
- In Section 3, explain more in detail how SIDL works.
