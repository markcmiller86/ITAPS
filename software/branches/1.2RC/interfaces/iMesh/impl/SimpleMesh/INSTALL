To build the GRUMMP TSTTM code, do the following:

1.  Run configure.  If your copy of Babel isn't in a standard place,
like /usr or /usr/local, you'll need to specify the option:

     --with-BABEL-dir=PATH

    PATH should point to where your babel implementation lives.  The Babel
    executable is assumed to be PATH/bin/babel, with the Babel run-time
    libraries in PATH/lib and include files in PATH/include.  If Babel
    is installed for system-wide use on your machine, PATH probably is
    /usr/local; in this case, you shouldn't need to specify this option. 

2.  Type make.  Note that make will download the GRUMMP distribution
    from its FTP server, if you haven't already done so.  This implies
    that you need a network connection and the patience to wait for
    about 2 megabytes of data to come through this connection.

    Once make is done, you can choose to 'make clean' to get rid of
    object files.
