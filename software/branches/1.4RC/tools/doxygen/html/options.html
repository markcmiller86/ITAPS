<h1><a class="anchor" id="options">Option Strings </a></h1><p>A few of the functions in iMesh support arbitrary options passed as a character string, called an 'Option String'. The format of and handling of an Option String is as follows...</p>
<p>1. Option Strings are INsensitive to case.</p>
<p>2. Each option in an Option String is pre-pended with the implementation name followed by a special character called the separator character.</p>
<p>3. The separator is a colon, ':'.</p>
<p>4. Multiple options existing in a single Option String are separated by a special character called the delimiter character.</p>
<p>5. The delimiter character is a space, ' '.</p>
<p>6. The effect of multiple options in a single Option String is INsensitive to order of occurrence in the string.</p>
<p>7. By default, implementations silently ignore any options that do not match on the implementation name part (everything before the separator character). This way, a caller may included options in a single string intended for multiple different implementations.</p>
<p>8. Implementations may (or may not) warn or error for option strings that match on implementation name part but are found to be in error for other reasons the implementation decides.</p>
<p>9. Whenever either the separator character, ':', or delimiter character, ' ', need to appear in an option, they must be escaped with the backslash character, '\'.</p>
<p>For example, consider the Options String</p>
<p>"grummp:silant FMDB:TwoPhaseIO moab:mpiio_hints\ foo\:bar"</p>
<p>In the above example, the space serves as the delimiter character between multiple options in the string. The colon serves as the implementation-name/option separator character. Because options are required to be insensitive to case, the caller is free to use case as a word separator as in 'TwoPhaseIO' and even in the implementation name, as in 'FMDB:', although 'fmdb:twophaseio' and 'fmdb:TWOPHASEIO' would all have the same effect. In the moab option, both the separator character and delimiter character appear in the option and so are pre-pended (e.g. escaped) with the backslash character.</p>
<p>GRUMMP will silently ignore the FMDB: and moab: options because they do NOT match on the implementation name part. However, GRUMMP may optionally error out, or warn or silently ignore 'grummp:silant' (it was supposed to be spelled 'silent') as an invalid option.</p>
<p>Note that iMesh itself currently does not define any options. In order to discover options a given implementation defines, users are directed to the developers of the respective implementations. </p>
