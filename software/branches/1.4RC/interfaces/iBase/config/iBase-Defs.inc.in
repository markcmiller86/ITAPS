# This file contains the essential make variables to facilitate building
# iMesh applications against an implementation as well as defines their
# meaning. The user's makefile simply needs to include this file.
#
# Note to developers: To produce the equivalent file for CMake based
# applications use the mkcmakedefs tool in the tools dir.
#
# As part of the ITAPS interface specifications, implementations are required
# to export values for CPPFLAGS, LIBS and DEPENDENCIES variables.


# The CPPFLAGS variable contains the -I compilation options needed to enable
# the compiler to find the implementation's include files.
IBASE_CPPFLAGS=

# The LIBS variable contains both the -L as well as the -l linker options to
# enable the linker to find the implementation's library files. Although it
# is more common GNU standard practice to separate -L options into LDFLAGS
# variable and -l options into LIBS variable, there can sometimes be problems
# with this when a make command needs to control the order of -L and -l options
# on the link line. So, we opt to compress both into a single LIBS variable and
# no LDFLAGS.
IBASE_LIBS=

# The DEPENDENCIES variable contains a list of files upon which the ABI exported
# by the implementation is dependent. If the files listed here change, then
# the make rules to re-make the client need to get triggered.
IBASE_DEPENDENCIES=
