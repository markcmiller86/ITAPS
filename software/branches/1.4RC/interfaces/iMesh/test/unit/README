1. To build the unit test suite against an iMesh implementation, run:

  ./configure --with-iMesh=/path/to/implementation
  make

This is a good time to be sure you set your LD_LIBRARY_PATH environment
variable so that your system can find shared libraries at runtime.

2. To run the unit tests, run

  ./iMesh_unitTest filename.vtk

Three test files are provided:

  rand1.vtk contains about 5000 tetrahedra.

  brick.vtk contains 1000 hexahedra, plus some edges and faces.

  globe_mats.vtk contains 40 tets, 160 pyramides, 200 prisms, and 800
    hexes; this is the prefered test file for implementations that
    support all entity types.
