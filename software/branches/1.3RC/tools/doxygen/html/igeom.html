<h1><a class="anchor" name="igeom">iGeom: ITAPS Geometry Interface</a></h1>The ITAPS Geometry Interface iGeom provides a common interface for accessing geometry and data associated with a mesh. Applications written to use this interface can use a variety of implementations, choosing the one that best meets its needs. They can also use tools written to this interface.<h2><a class="anchor" name="ITAPS">
Data Model</a></h2>
The ITAPS interfaces use a data model composed of four basic data types:<br>
 <em>Entity:</em> basic topological entities in a model, e.g. vertices, edges, faces, regions. <br>
 <em>Entity</em> <em>Set:</em> arbitrary grouping of other entities and sets. Entity sets also support parent/child relations with other sets which are distinct from entities contained in those sets. Parent/child links can be used to embed graph relationships between sets, e.g. to represent topological relationships between the sets. <br>
 <em>Interface:</em> the object with which model is associated and on which functions in iGeom are called. <br>
 <em>Tag:</em> application data associated with objects of any of the other data types. Each tag has a designated name, size, and data type.<h2><a class="anchor" name="ITAPS">
Data Model</a></h2>
Each entity has a specific Entity Type. The Entity Type is one of VERTEX, EDGE, FACE, and REGION, and is synonymous with the topological dimension of the entity. Entity Type is an enumerated type in the iBase_EntityType enumeration.<h2><a class="anchor" name="ITAPS">
Data Model</a></h2>
The iGeom interface provides functions for accessing entities individually, as arrays of entities, or using iterators. These access methods have different memory versus execution time tradeoffs, depending on the implementation. <hr size="1"><address style="align: right;"><small>
