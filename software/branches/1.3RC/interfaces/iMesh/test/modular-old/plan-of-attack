General idea:

  o Test harness should be able to read a VTK file, with arbitrary
  connectivity, and infer faces/edges from cells.  A micro
  implementation of the GRUMMP database could provide this:  create
  entities from verts.  This micro implementation would have to be in a
  namespace or something to prevent name clashes.

  o Implementation to be tested must have the same data available.

  o Ideally, test every function that the implmentation actually has,
  and provide output on what functionality is available and whether it
  works.  Alternatively, take as input the list of things to test.
