# This file contains variables that are essential for building
# applications on iBase implementations without having to hack
# application Makefiles horribly each time.  Instead, one can simply
# re-run configure in the application tree with a new -with-ITAPS-dir
# argument, and the implementation-specific version of this file gets
# included automatically.  The application programmer/user can also just
# edit the pathname in their Makefile if they prefer.
