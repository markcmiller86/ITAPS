iMesh wrappers for the Zoltan toolkit.

To use these wrappers, download an iMesh implementation (which is used in the
example), siMPI (which comes with Zoltan), ParMETIS3_1 (optional), Zoltan
(from www.cs.sandia.gov/Zoltan), and these wrappers to subdirectories in your
home directory and build them in that order.  ParMETIS3_1 and Zoltan should
both be configured and built with siMPI.  If the option for ParMETIS3_1 is not
going to be exercised, Zoltan should be configured and built without
ParMETIS3_1 as well.  To build these wrappers, run the configure file with the
relevant path to iMesh-Defs.inc and directories to mpi.h, libsimpi.a,
libparmetis.a (optional), zoltan_cpp.h, and libzoltan.a to generate the
Makefile; run make; and run the resulting executable, iMeshZoltanTest, on test
data for iMesh.  ITAPSZoltanTest.cpp contains a C++ example of Zoltan library
use with iMesh.  If the option for ParMETIS3_1 is not exercised, the options
for ParMETIS3_1 cannot be used.
