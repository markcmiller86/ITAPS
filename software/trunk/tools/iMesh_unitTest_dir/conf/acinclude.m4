dnl This file is intended for macros that are specific to a pa
dnl implementation or application.  For example, if an implementation needs
dnl some external libraries at link time, then these also need to be in the
dnl top-level configure so that they can end up in i*-Defs.inc.  Putting
dnl the macros that do these checks into acinclude.m4 is an easy way to do
dnl this for complex checks.
