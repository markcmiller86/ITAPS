o Function specifying how ents can be created (like adjacency table).

o Function specifying min connectivity to store (like adjacency table).

o Should have an ENTITY_IN_USE error type, for situations where an entity
can't be deleted.

o IMO, the various errors that get returned (as per spec) should be
checked for in debug code, but not necessarily in production code.  That
is, if your implementation is configured with --enable-debugging and/or
--enable-assertions or similar, then all the errors should be returned
properly.  But for production code, presumably all the silly mistakes
that can invoke these errors will be fixed, so these tests aren't
strictly necessary (and may be expensive).

o Error handling still wildly different in MOAB.

o 2D vs 3D coords:  return xyxy or xy0xy0?  Ditto for set.

o Iterators for impossible type/topo combinations: should return an
iterator that iterates over nothing, IMO.
