getErrorType:  WTH?  We just had the error type returned to us.  Why ask
for it again?  Is this a SIDL holdover?  Regardless, nuke it!

getDescription:  Is this supposed to be generic and standard or
implementation and context specific?  Regardless, how should one test
it?  And shouldn't that be int err, not int* err?  (That is, shouldn't
the error code be -input- from the caller?)

iBase_BAD_ARRAY_DIMENSION is redundant with iBase_BAD_ARRAY_SIZE (since
we no longer have 2D SIDL arrays).  Only used in Jason's implementation
of getEntAdjIndices, which has gone viral. :-)

Should iMesh_newMesh (and other functions taking string options return
an error code when an unrecognized option is passed (i.e.,
prefix:asdf).  If so, how does one test this, considering that the
prefix is unknown to the app except by the programmer reading the docs?

Should NIL_ARRAY be returned for input arrays that have non-zero size
and null pointer?  (Yes, almost certainly.)  What if the size is zero,
too?  In this case it's less clear, because an implementation can return
no data and never have to de-reference the null pointer.
