This package contains a preliminary release of the swapping service,
written to use the ITAPS C API.

To build, you'll need to:

1.  Run configure.  Use the --with-iMesh=path argument to specify the
location of your iMesh implementation.  For iMesh implementations that
can't build tetrahedra from faces (this includes MOAB), you'll also need
to use --enable-tets-from-verts.

2.  Run make.

3.  Run make test to build a 3D swapping executable and test it on an
included mesh file.  You should expect a total of roughly 11,000 swaps
(add up the "Performed XXXX swaps" lines in the program output).

To build your app with the swapping libraries, you'll need to add the
appropriate -I, -L, and -lSwapping to your Makefile, and include
ITAPS_Swap.hh in your source file.  At this point, even though the
swapping code uses the ITAPS C API, the swapping code itself is written
in C++, so from C or Fortran you'll need a wrapper layer of some sort.
