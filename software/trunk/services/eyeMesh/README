Dependencies:
    The eyeMesh browser requires Qt version 4 or newer. Newer systems
    have Qt4 by default. Older systems may have had Qt4 installed on
    them after their initial deployment. Otherwise, you can obtain
    Qt4 here, http://qt.nokia.com/downloads/embedded-linux-cpp

Building:
    If your system has Qt version 4 by default, usually the following
    commands are sufficient to build the eyeMesh browser...

        ./configure IMESH_DEFS=<path-to-iMesh-Defs.inc-file>
        make

    where <path-to-iMesh-Defs.inc-file> is a path to the iMesh-Defs.inc
    file for the iMesh implementation you are using can be found.

    Note, eyeMesh can be linked with only one iMesh implementation at
    any one time. The same eyeMesh executable is not capable of reading
    files from multiple different iMesh implementations.

    If your system's default Qt is NOT Qt version 4 but it is available
    and/or you have downloaded and installed Qt version 4, then you can
    tell configure where to find it using the --with-qt-dir configure
    option as in...

        ./configure --with-qt-dir=<path-to-qt4>

    The command

        ./configure --help

    displays all the options for configuring and building eyeMesh.
